<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> story of <i>Vinzi</i> is one of the freshest and
most attractive to be found in modern literature,
yielding not at all to the author&#8217;s better-known
<i>Heidi</i>. It is sure to delight all children and as
many of their elders as have retained their youthful
sympathies. The revival of other stories by
Madame Spyri has shown that her simple charm
never fails to win an increasing audience, but in
<i>Vinzi</i> her gift is positively at its best. In none of
her books is the interest centered and sustained
more perfectly.</p>

<p>There are few things more enjoyable or
profitable for children than to learn how children
live in other countries. It stimulates their
imaginations and enlarges their emotional powers
in the healthiest manner possible. For this purpose
the Swiss background of Madame Spyri&#8217;s
books is particularly good, with its flood of sunlight
over Alpine peaks and flowery meadows.
And as the background, so the people; there is
an unforced kindliness and heartiness in the
characters that makes them lovable in a special
way of their own. Their foibles and limitations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
merely increase the genuineness of their appeal.</p>

<p>Two themes are stressed in <i>Vinzi</i>, trust and
the power of music. Both of these are timely today.
We hardly need Monsieur Coué to tell us
that a brave confidence in the future is one of the
most valuable qualities of character, especially
for a child. Philosophers, both theoretical and
practical, dilate on the importance of freeing ourselves
from fear and discouragement as early in
life as possible. This is just what the story of
<i>Vinzi</i> tends to do by presenting the small hero
as a natural example of the well-known principle.
No less practical is the influence of good music
upon children, the value of which is just beginning
to be properly recognized in school and home.</p>

<p>But no moralizing ever interferes with the
course of the narrative, which flows along with a
delicate intuition as to suspense and climax.
The boy Vinzi&#8217;s love of music and his father&#8217;s determination
to make a farmer of him provide the
central motive. It is noteworthy that the father,
who with a less skilful author would be the villain
of the tale, is never made to lose our respect. But
the best feature of the book is the joyous life of
the children, which occupies by far the most space.
Madame Spyri&#8217;s panacea for the ills of life is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
old one, but it is doubtful whether anything better
can be found than her combination, which is:
Faith in God, active helpfulness toward all
around, love of beauty, fresh mountain air, and
good food. Surely so much happiness has seldom
been packed within the covers of a children&#8217;s book
as may be found in <i>Vinzi</i>.</p>

<small>IN LEUK</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE June sun was streaming down upon
the green slope above the village of
Leuk, and the fresh green grass which
covered the heights as far as the eye could see
filled the air with fragrance. At an isolated
house along the path which led to the baths of
Leuk, two women were lost in lively talk; indeed
it seemed as if they could never come to the end
of everything they had to say to each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Marianna,&#8221; said the more talkative of
the two, &#8220;if you could furnish a couple of rooms
the way I did, you would soon realize a good
profit. You could soon get boarders among the
people who have relatives at the baths. You
know some of them do not want to go there, or
are not allowed to, just like the three who are
staying with me. You really are a little too far
down, for people like to go a little higher up in the
summer. If only you were living where those
people over there do. They certainly have the
best spot on the slope and own all the very best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
meadows. But I do not think much of them,&#8221;
the woman concluded with an unfriendly glance
toward the house which stood a little higher up
and away from the road. &#8220;They are nearly
eaten up with pride, especially she, and you ought
to see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way do they show it?&#8221; Marianna
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way? You might just as well ask
in what way they don&#8217;t show it,&#8221; Magdalene replied
quickly. &#8220;They show it in everything. In
everything they do and in the way they dress as
if it were always Sunday with them. She has
brought up the children to be just as particular
as she is. The boy&#8217;s black hair is always curled
as if he were going to the church fair and the little
one always carries her nose high in the air as if
she meant to say, &#8216;Watch out, here I come!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can the little one help it if her nose
has grown that way?&#8221; was Marianna&#8217;s opinion.
&#8220;And the boy can&#8217;t help his curly hair either.
Doesn&#8217;t the woman speak to you when you
meet her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, she does, and I would not exactly
advise her to let her pride go as far as that,&#8221; said
Magdalene in a threatening manner, &#8220;but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
are mistaken if you imagine that she ever stops
a minute to say a few words to a neighbor. If one
starts to talk with her, she just gives a short
answer and hurries away as if she did not think
one her equal. She can wait awhile before I ever
say anything to her again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marianna looked at the house in question and
exclaimed full of astonishment, &#8220;How is that?
As long as I can remember, the house over there
looked old and gray, not a window was ever
opened, and all the panes were dirty and dull
from age. It looked like a robber&#8217;s den. Now it
is snow-white and the windows shine in the sun.
It can&#8217;t be the same house!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly is! Now you can see how proud
they are,&#8221; replied Magdalene eagerly. &#8220;Old
farmer Lesa lived there with his old housekeeper
more than fifty years; all that time he did not
hammer in a single nail, for he was satisfied with
the way it had been in his father&#8217;s and his grandfather&#8217;s
time. Just as soon as his eyes were closed,
his heir came across the Gemmi<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and things
were torn down, cleaned and renewed until one
might think a count was moving in. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the woman was the cause of it all, for nothing
that the parents had admired was good enough
for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I should think that it was not unnecessary
to clean and straighten up a bit if the last
owner had not fixed up a nail in the house for
fifty years and had let things go as his father and
grandfather had left them,&#8221; replied Marianna.
&#8220;The old house certainly was ugly, and how
changed it is! Why did you say that his heir
came from across the Gemmi? Are the Lesas not
from our parts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they are, and there are several of that
name hereabouts,&#8221; replied Magdalene, &#8220;but one
of them is supposed to have married across the
Gemmi and to have stayed there with his wife
near Berne or Freiburg. But I only know this
from hearsay, for it was either a hundred or two
hundred years ago. When old Lesa died, it
was found that his nearest relatives were the same
we were talking of, so it happened that Vinzenz
Lesa moved here with his wife and two children
about two years ago. I heard that there too they
have a fine house and a lot of cows, and that their
pastures over there are very fine, as well as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
breed of cattle. I think Vinzenz&#8217;s brother now
takes care of the other place. I do not know
whether Vinzenz is going back there again when
he has put everything here in good shape, nor
whether he means to sell this place, for he does
not say much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, I must go,&#8221; Marianna exclaimed,
quite startled when she heard the sound of a bell
from the village below. &#8220;I have to go up to the
baths, and I must not get back too late, because
my husband and the children don&#8217;t like to be kept
waiting for supper. Where did old Lesa&#8217;s housekeeper
go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was his cousin and died a short time
after him,&#8221; Magdalene informed her. &#8220;She had
been with him fifty years and was well past
seventy, so she could not very well have started
on anything new. Look, there they come towards
us across the meadow. Now you can see for
yourself Lesa&#8217;s wife and her dressed-up children;
just wait till she comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marianna needed no further urging for she
was curious to see the people they had
been discussing.</p>

<p>They were coming close, and one could see
that the children had a great deal to tell their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
mother. They talked to her steadily so that one
might have thought the woman could not possibly
see or hear anything else. As soon, however, as
she reached the house where the two women had
withdrawn a little into the open doorway, she
greeted them pleasantly. The boy immediately
pulled off his cap and the girl called out &#8220;Good-day&#8221;
with a ringing voice. When they had gone
a few steps further, their lively conversation
began anew.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must say they look nice,&#8221; said Marianna,
gazing after the group with visible satisfaction.
&#8220;I see no pride there, Magdalene, but neatness
and cleanliness in the children as well as in the
mother. Everything looks well on her and I
wonder how she does it. She just wore what we
do, only it looks better on her. Didn&#8217;t the boy&#8217;s
black curls tumble out from his cap in a nice way!
And I like the way the little one with the snub
nose has her brown hair braided about her head.
She looks as bright and happy as a little bird.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else have you to say?&#8221; retorted
Magdalene, slightly annoyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right; I should do better to go my
way instead of idly talking,&#8221; said Marianna, getting
ready to leave. &#8220;It does one good to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
people who teach their children good manners
and keep them as if they meant to make them
into something decent. There are too many of the
other kind, and one often wonders if it is possible
to raise children to anything good. That woman
has given me a mind to imitate her as far as I can,
for I&#8217;d like my children to look as nice and speak
as politely as hers. I must go now. Do not take
amiss anything I said. Good-bye, Magdalene.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marianna set out now and hurried along towards
the height. Mrs. Lesa in the meantime
climbed up the mountain slope with her children.
They kept on talking steadily, sometimes the boy
alone or the girl, and sometimes both at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just think, mother,&#8221; the boy informed her,
&#8220;the child is hardly any bigger than Stefeli.
When we passed Mrs. Troll&#8217;s house yesterday
evening we first saw her standing before the door,
then she ran into the house and suddenly we
heard the most beautiful music through the open
window. I asked the brother who had stayed
outside with a book what it was and he said,
&#8216;Alida is playing the piano.&#8217; Imagine, such a
young child! I should have loved to listen a while,
but I was afraid to, because Stefeli said that it
was late and we had to go home.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>&#8220;And so it was,&#8221; Stefeli affirmed. &#8220;I should
have loved to stay, too, but we had to go home.
Don&#8217;t you remember, father was already at table
when we came? I found out that the boy&#8217;s name
is Hugo and that the crooked lady lives with them,
because I heard Alida say to her brother,
&#8216;I simply have to go in now, otherwise Fraulein
will fetch me in and everything will go crooked.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Stefeli, it was not meant that way,&#8221;
said the mother. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think the lady is
crooked. The idea probably was that things
would go crooked with Alida if she did not obey.
Are not the children&#8217;s parents with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No I don&#8217;t think so, but I am not sure.
What do you think, Vinzi?&#8221; asked Stefeli, turning
toward her brother.</p>

<p>He gave no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you stare into the distance,
Vinzi, and why don&#8217;t you answer?&#8221; now asked
the mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, mother, listen!&#8221; Vinzi replied in a
low voice. &#8220;Can you hear those beautiful sounds?&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother stood still. The wind was wafting
up the sounds of an evening bell from the
valley, which, as they reached the heights, faded
away only to rise more loudly from far below.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
The wind must have come straight from that
direction, for one could hear them very plainly.
Now the tones had died away.</p>

<p>The mother&#8217;s glance rested on the boy with
a mingled look of anxiety and surprise, while
he was lost in listening. She remained quiet a
while longer for Vinzi had not yet moved. He
still seemed to listen eagerly to something he
heard from far away, despite the fact that no more
sounds reached her ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vinzi, can you hear us again now?&#8221; Stefeli
asked, not in the least surprised at her
brother&#8217;s ways.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he responded as if awakening from
a dream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the lady who lives with Alida and Hugo
really crooked?&#8221; asked Stefeli, for she was anxious
to have that question cleared up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, perhaps,&#8221; the brother replied with a
slightly abstracted air.</p>

<p>But Stefeli did not tolerate such uncertainty.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she is not crooked, she is straight, but
you must not say perhaps,&#8221; she exclaimed, a little
angry. &#8220;We can easily go down right away to
Mrs. Troll&#8217;s house, can&#8217;t we, mother, and then
we&#8217;ll find out what the lady is like.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the mother, &#8220;we shall certainly
not go back to the house on account of that. It
is, however, time to turn back, otherwise father
will get home sooner than we do and that must
not happen. We had better return the way we
came, it is the shortest way. But, Stefeli, you
must not think that we&#8217;ll stop at Mrs. Troll&#8217;s
house till we see those people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They may be sitting in front of the house,&#8221;
said Stefeli, holding fast to her intention.</p>

<p>As the mother turned back the little girl ran
ahead; she wanted to see the house as soon as
possible in order to discover anybody who might
be sitting there. The question they had been discussing
was not however the only thing on her
mind. Stefeli longed most of all to see the two
strange children who had moved into the house
and whom she had seen the evening before.</p>

<p>Vinzi quietly wandered along at his mother&#8217;s
side. He was not talkative any longer, but his
mother was well accustomed to these changes in
her boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Vinzi,&#8221; she asked now, &#8220;why did
you keep on listening after the sound of the evening
bells had died away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could still hear them,&#8221; Vinzi answered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
&#8220;I suddenly heard such a wonderful song, which
came down from the hills; the black fir trees
seemed to join in with a deep bass and through
it all the bells were tinkling their sparkling
melody. Oh, it was beautiful! If only I could
repeat it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it a song you have heard before?&#8221;
the mother asked sympathetically, seeking to
understand. &#8220;If you sang me part of it I might
find out which song you mean and tell you the
words of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; Vinzi remonstrated, &#8220;it is no song
I ever heard. The melodies were all entirely new.
I still hear them but can&#8217;t repeat them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meditating deeply the mother remained
silent, for she could not understand what Vinzi
meant. She herself had always found much
pleasure in music and singing. She had taught
her children to sing as soon as they were able to
talk, and her boy had always enjoyed their daily
evening song.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Vinzi,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;let us sing
a song now; then we&#8217;ll both feel happy again.
Which one do you want to sing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, mother; if only I could sing
the tune I hear,&#8221; he answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>&#8220;I suppose you have some music running in
your head. Sing out and you can&#8217;t help enjoying
it,&#8221; said the mother, starting up a song Vinzi
knew well.</p>

<p>At first he hesitated, but soon the well-known
melody carried him along. His clear, sure voice
joining hers, they finished the song before they
reached Mrs. Troll&#8217;s cottage. Stefeli suddenly
leaped forward from behind a tree, from which
hidden spot she had watched the two children who
were both sitting in front of the house with a book.
It had not escaped Stefeli that Alida did not
look much at her book and was constantly turning
her head from side to side to see what might
be going on. Stefeli was dreadfully anxious to
run over to Alida and start a friendship with her.
But suddenly the governess, who was not crooked
at all, but on the contrary very stiff and straight,
came out of the house. This intimidated Stefeli
so much she hid further and further behind the
tree in order not to be discovered. Stefeli told
her mother and brother of these things and was
glad to have them by her side when passing the
house, because the governess was still sitting
there. When closer, all four children eagerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
examined each other, for they were very
much interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are the same ones we saw yesterday,&#8221;
Alida said with half-raised voice. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll
go over and make their acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed you won&#8217;t Alida! We don&#8217;t
even know who they are,&#8221; quickly replied
the governess.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the words had been
spoken under her breath, those who were passing
had been able to hear them.</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t want Alida to talk with us, did
you hear it, mother?&#8221; said Stefeli when they had
gone a little further.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; the mother replied. &#8220;It is
lucky that you didn&#8217;t run over to them. You
must never do it, Stefeli; do you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but then we&#8217;ll never meet and Alida
wanted to so much,&#8221; Stefeli said rebelliously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Stefeli, the governess probably
has charge of the children&#8217;s education and is responsible
for what they do and with whom they
play. They might hear and learn from others
all kinds of things that they shouldn&#8217;t do,&#8221; the
mother explained. &#8220;Maybe Alida is a little like
you, Stefeli, and likes to stick her little nose into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
every opening and look through every hole in
a hedge. That is probably why the governess
has to watch her and choose her friends
very carefully.&#8221;</p>

<p>This made Stefeli more eager than ever to
meet Alida and be her friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see father over there,&#8221; said Vinzi. &#8220;We
ought to hurry if we want to get home at the
same time as he does.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the mother&#8217;s intention, and, walking
fast, they joined the father not far from the
house. Soon afterwards the little family sat
down to supper in their comfortable room.</p>

<p>The meal passed very quietly because the
children knew that they had to be silent, and the
parents themselves said little. As soon as the
children had finished, Vinzi asked, &#8220;Can we go
out?&#8221; As the request was readily granted, they
hurried over to the barn, where many delightful
corners could be found for playing hide and seek.</p>

<p>It was a bright, warm June evening. Vinzenz
Lesa had leisurely risen from the table, and going
out he lit his pipe and settled himself on the
bench before the house. His wife soon afterwards
came out and sat down, too. Now he grew
talkative and told her of a visit he had made to
an acquaintance of his in the valley whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
meadows, fields and cattle he had examined. He
had compared his own property with what he
saw, and when he had thoroughly looked everything
over he could not help saying to himself,
&#8220;Vinzenz Lesa, you are blessed with a
fine property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we certainly ought to be grateful and
I am sure we are,&#8221; said his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is true,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;but whenever
I am very happy about it and begin to plan
how to improve and develop the farm it always
seems as if some one were throwing an obstacle
before my feet and keeping me from going
further. I mean Vinzi. For whom should I do
all of it if not for him, and what kind of a boy
is he? He has no eyes in his head and shows not
the slightest pleasure or interest in taking to
pasture the most beautiful cows that can be
found far and wide in the whole neighborhood. If
I say to him, &#8216;Just look what wonderful fodder
is in this meadow!&#8217; he says &#8216;yes&#8217; and stares into
the distance so one can see that he has neither
listened nor really looked at the meadow he is
standing in. I am afraid there is something
wrong with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Vinzenz, you must not say that,&#8221;
his wife interrupted eagerly. &#8220;If Vinzi does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
always listen and has his thoughts elsewhere and
does not show the real pleasure he should have
in farming, he has never done anything wrong.
You must not say that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say it,&#8221; the man went on, &#8220;but what
is wrong is wrong, and when a boy has no feeling
for such meadows, fields and cows as we own, and
everything connected with a farm, something
must be wrong. But I am sure I don&#8217;t know how
to help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may yet change; just think how young
he is!&#8221; said the wife comfortingly, though her
secret anxiety about the boy had grown again
that day during her stroll. She knew well enough
that there was something about the boy difficult
to understand and she also realized that his
thoughts never were on the objects before him.
Deeming it wise to change the subject, she talked
about seeing the strangers who had taken the upstairs
rooms at Mrs. Troll&#8217;s cottage for the
summer. She told him that the children had
looked so nice that she would not mind taking
them into her own home. This might easily be
managed in their big house, where a few nice
rooms could be fitted up for that purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what on earth will you say next, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
can&#8217;t we even have peace in our own house?&#8221; said
the man, half frightened, half angry. &#8220;Why
should we take other people&#8217;s children into our
house when we have children of our own?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they are as nice as those we saw, and as
well brought up, ours could only learn good
things from them,&#8221; answered the woman. &#8220;We
all like to see our children clean and well-behaved
rather than tumbling about like little pigs and
using rough words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, all children have bad manners, and
when they get too bad one can let them know. I
know quite well what you are aiming at, but you
might just as well give it up because there is no
use,&#8221; the farmer said. &#8220;I shall not tolerate
strangers in the house. I mean to live by myself
and I absolutely forbid the children to have anything
to do with those city folks. Don&#8217;t let them
go over there or our girl will soon become as
spoilt as the boy. I am glad to say she is still different
from him. She runs after the cows and
strokes them like friends and the young cattle
run after her, eat from her hand and rub their
heads against her like comrades. If one says
anything, the child pays attention and minds her
business and uses her own eyes besides. She
knows exactly what is lacking in the barn or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
stable and knows how everything should be. But
the boy neither sees nor knows anything. It
would be quite different if I could change those
two around, make the girl into the boy, and the
boy into the girl. But as long as things have to
be as they are, I have no inclination to have her
changed, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The way you talk, Vinzenz, one might think
you consider it a sickness to be well brought up,&#8221;
the woman replied calmly. &#8220;But you need have
no fears; a governess is looking after those
children who is going to see to it that hers don&#8217;t
come near ours. It is late, we had better go
in now.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same time she called to the children to
sing their daily evening song. As soon as they
arrived the mother began, and both joined in with
clear, sure voices. They knew the song well and
each apparently had a good ear for music. Even
as little children they had been able to repeat the
mother&#8217;s songs correctly. As the beautiful
melody was resounding through the calm, peaceful
evening air, father Vinzenz regained his usual
composure, which had been so disturbed that day
by anxious thoughts and fears.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>ON THE PASTURE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE children had no school during the
summer months because at that time
they were all needed for light tasks in
the fields and meadows. School began again late
in the autumn.</p>

<p>On Monday morning the sun had only just
flushed the tops of the mountains before rising
above the wooded heights, when, early as it was,
Stefeli, already neatly washed and dressed,
rushed into Vinzi&#8217;s little chamber. She found
him still fast asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up, Vinzi,&#8221; she cried out. &#8220;The man
has just brought back the cows from the pond
and as soon as we have had breakfast, father
wants us to go up to the pasture to watch them.
The man has to come back when we get there.
We&#8217;ll take lunch with us and stay all day long
because it&#8217;s too far to come all the way home.
Won&#8217;t we have fun eating out of doors?
Please hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi had awakened meanwhile. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
gazed at his sister with his large dark eyes he still
seemed lost in revery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I had such a wonderful dream,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Mother and I were in Litten, the place we went
to last year. We went to church together and
everything was exactly as we had seen it then.
An organ was playing the most beautiful piece
and it was more wonderful than I could tell you.
Do you know what an organ sounds like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Vinzi, you must come now. Please
hurry up and don&#8217;t talk about an organ now,&#8221;
Stefeli urged. &#8220;Mother has already taken in the
coffee and father is having breakfast. You
know we won&#8217;t have any fun if father gets cross.
Do hurry up.&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words Stefeli ran away.</p>

<p>Vinzi had realized the truth of his sister&#8217;s
words. He quickly jumped out of bed and completed
his necessary toilet. Soon he stood in the
room ready to start off. He speedily swallowed
his milk and coffee and stuck the bread into his
pocket, before the three others had half finished
theirs. The father, looking at the boy, thought
to himself, &#8220;He can hurry if he wants to. Perhaps
something can still be done with him.&#8221; The
mother had packed the children&#8217;s lunch neatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
into a bag, which she hung around Vinzi&#8217;s
shoulder. Stefeli now came skipping along with
a straw hat on her head and in her hand a rod
which Vinzi had cut for her. This she used for
gently urging the cows ahead whenever they
needed it, but she never beat them. When the
children went out, followed by the parents, Vinzi
discovered that he had left his whip in the barn.
All cow-herds carried one in order just for fun
to flick it sharply from time to time. A sound
like thunder would re-echo from the mountains
roundabout. As Vinzi did not care for this pastime
with the whip he regularly forgot where he
had put it. While he hunted about uncertainly
his father began to frown. But suddenly, in leaps
and bounds, his sister, who had noticed where he
had left it, appeared with the whip.</p>

<p>At last the children started off. &#8220;Keep the
cows from going across the stream, Vinzi,&#8221; the
father called after them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care not to go too near the rushing
stream yourselves,&#8221; was the mother&#8217;s last
reminder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the children called back gaily, as
they hurried along towards the mountain pasture.
As soon as they arrived Stefeli began to shout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
violently. She had not forgotten that their man
was to return to the farm as soon as they had
arrived to take charge of the cows. He did not
hear for quite a while because he happened to be
on the other side of the roaring stream. Stefeli,
however, did not give up till he had heard and
understood her cries. He then hurried away.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to see that the cows stay on our own
pasture and that Schwärzeli does not jump about
too much, for if she doesn&#8217;t eat she&#8217;ll get thin,&#8221;
said Stefeli. &#8220;Come, Vinzi, let&#8217;s sit down over
there under the tree; for if we leave our bag in
the sun, the bread will get dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi, who had already settled down, got up.
He followed Stefeli, watching her while she carefully
laid their provisions in the shadow of the
broadest branches. Then they both sat down in
the cool shade under the spreading tree where
earlier the ground had been thoroughly dried by
the sun.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_034fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">THE SHINY BLACK COW WAS GOING IN BIG LEAPS TOWARD
THE RUSHING STREAM</p>

<p>The fresh morning wind was soughing through
the branches and blowing over the pasture far
and wide till its roaring was finally lost in the
distance. Suddenly Stefeli bounded up and shot
away like an arrow. With tail raised high the
shiny black cow was going in big leaps towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the rushing stream. &#8220;Schwärzeli, Schwärzeli,&#8221;
the child called repeatedly, &#8220;Schwärzeli, please
wait for me!&#8221; But the high-spirited animal only
jumped higher and had nearly reached the
stream. &#8220;She will drown if she jumps in,&#8221;
thought Stefeli, terribly frightened. By that
time they had come to the dangerous place of
which the mother had warned her. &#8220;Schwärzeli!&#8221;
the child called once more with so much authority
in her excited voice that far and wide her echo
repeated, &#8220;Schwärzeli, Schwärzeli!&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly the fugitive stood still and turned
around, while Stefeli rushed breathlessly towards
the young heifer, who was quietly awaiting the
arrival of her mistress.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a bad Schwärzeli to scare me so,&#8221;
Stefeli exclaimed, firmly grasping the rope about
Schwärzeli&#8217;s neck, on which a little bell was
fastened. &#8220;Just wait! If you go on like this
I certainly won&#8217;t bring you any more salt to lick.
You know you love it as if it were good sugar!&#8221;
Schwärzeli was tenderly rubbing her head on
Stefeli&#8217;s shoulder now as if to say, &#8220;I meant
no harm, but it is such fun to caper across
the meadow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; Stefeli answered, as if she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
understood everything Schwärzeli had been trying
to express, &#8220;you want me to forgive you now,
but stop running towards the stream. You can
run towards the other side all you want. Oh, I
see, you think it more fun to run downhill than
uphill. I know. Come along with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the two wandered peacefully back to the
place which was meant to be the pasture of the
day, Vinzi met them half way. Quite surprised,
he asked, &#8220;But Stefeli, why did you run away?
It was so nice under the tree. I was hearing the
most beautiful music. I was just going to ask
you if you heard it too, when I found you were
gone. Only then I saw you coming back
with Schwärzeli.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite being used to her brother&#8217;s ways,
Stefeli could not help being astonished that he
had not been aware of what was going on. She
told him about the chase and her great fear that
Schwärzeli might gallop straight towards the
stream, fall down the banks and drown. It was
lucky that the little beast had suddenly become
manageable. Stefeli was eager to know what
Vinzi had heard in the meanwhile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is such a shame you did not hear it,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;for one can hardly describe such music.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
A chorus of deep, strong voices was rising from
the tree above me and floating far across the
meadow. Then high, clear voices joined in and
were lost in the distance till they resembled the
sounds of waters far away. Oh, it was so beautiful.
Come, we might still hear it if we go back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go now, Schwärzeli, and behave yourself,&#8221;
said Stefeli, letting go of the rope by which she
had held the heifer. Then she followed Vinzi.</p>

<p>But she had scarcely settled down beside Vinzi
when both jumped up again. They noticed simultaneously
that the brown cow had strolled as far
as a fence which formed the boundary between
their own and another pasture. In order to get
through she was pushing hard against the boards.
Soon the children had fetched her back and the
cow was slowly wandering to the proper field.
Stefeli discovered an especially inviting spot
where fragrant mountain pinks were nodding in
the grass. &#8220;Come, Vinzi, we&#8217;ll stay here. I am
sure we couldn&#8217;t possibly hear the tunes any
more.&#8221; To this Vinzi gladly assented. A great
peace enveloped the heights, and the cows
were quietly wandering about. Schwärzeli was
usually either at the head or the rear of them, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
she gave no more disorderly leaps. Only when
changing ground she trotted about a bit.</p>

<p>The children looked with happy faces at the
lovely scene before them. After enjoying it
silently for a while, Stefeli said, &#8220;I should just
love to be a cow-herd all my life. Would you like
it, too, Vinzi?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I should not like it,&#8221; was his answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why not?&#8221; Stefeli questioned a little reproachfully.
&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t anywhere be more
beautiful than here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s true,&#8221; Vinzi admitted, &#8220;but I
should not like to take care of cows all my
life. I should like another profession better than
watching them and keeping them from running
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you rather do?&#8221; Stefeli wanted
to know.</p>

<p>After meditating a little Vinzi answered, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know what the profession is in which I could
do what I like best of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you like to do best? I never saw
you do it, I think,&#8221; Stefeli said, quite surprised
that she should not know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like above all to listen to the bells and all
the sounds in the branches of the trees. Also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
those that drift down from the mountains on all
sides. Can you hear how it seems to sing everywhere
about us? Can you hear it?&#8221; Vinzi&#8217;s eyes
grew more large and gleaming while he listened.</p>

<p>Stefeli pricked up her ears. &#8220;Those are only
the gnats,&#8221; she said in a slightly disdainful voice.</p>

<p>But Vinzi, continued: &#8220;When I hear such
beautiful sounds I always try to remember them
so that I can sing them or imitate them. I wonder
how I could do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that couldn&#8217;t be a real profession,&#8221;
Stefeli interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I am afraid of, too,&#8221; Vinzi admitted,
quite discouraged, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t help
thinking about it all the time. I have cut so many
pipes and have tried out what one can play on
them. I already have made five; on one I can
blow very deep, and on another very high tones,
and the others can play middle tones. I was just
puzzling out how to play two or three at the same
time, so that they could all sound at once like the
church bells.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might become a piper,&#8221; Stefeli exclaimed,
quite happy over her inspiration, &#8220;that
might be quite a good profession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Vinzi replied uncertainly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
&#8220;Father would surely not let me, even if I could.
He found my pipes in the barn one day and
threw them all away. He told me to think of
useful things instead of collecting pipes and
thinking about such rubbish.&#8221; Poor Vinzi was
quite depressed at those memories and it smote
Stefeli&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t get sad on account of that,
Vinzi,&#8221; she said comfortingly. &#8220;I am sure father
just meant you not to have the pipes at home in
the barn and stable. But why shouldn&#8217;t you have
them up here in the pasture and think about them.
I can easily watch and call out when I need you.
Then you can go on cutting your pipes and we can
put them into a hole under a tree and take them
out when we are up here. I could help you blow
them. I&#8217;ll blow the high one and you can play
the low one and they&#8217;ll sound together like
the bells.&#8221;</p>

<p>But these words failed to give Vinzi thorough
consolation. He kept sadly staring at the ground
before him and saying nothing more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about something else, now,&#8221; his
sister said decidedly, for she did not like the effect
their conversation had had on Vinzi. But before
another subject was begun Stefeli started up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
violently, and calling her brother, flew away.
Vinzi, glancing up, ran after her toward a party
of strangers, who had been going over a narrow
wooden bridge which led across the stream, when
a little dog belonging to them suddenly darted
into the midst of the cows and yelping loudly,
drove them in every direction. The scared
animals rushed hither and thither in their fright,
and Schwärzeli, with her tail raised high, was
galloping to and fro. This urged the dog to
still more furious onslaughts. Stefeli rushed
after the cows to quiet them, while Vinzi, going
straight up to the dog, applied his whip so vigorously
that the animal turned about and ran whining
after the party. All this had proved to be
such hot work that the children sought together
the welcome shade under the big tree and flung
themselves down there. They felt in need of regaining
their breath and cooling off under the
deliciously swaying branches. The cows also
were peaceful again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish the dog had been on the side where the
path leads up to the pasture,&#8221; Vinzi said now,
sitting up. &#8220;I saw the most brilliant red flower
there and it looked perfectly enormous, even from
where I was. I never saw a bigger one; I&#8217;d run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
down to get it if it were not so far away. It is
getting very hot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can find it,&#8221; Stefeli said with determination.
&#8220;If the flower is so wonderful I won&#8217;t
mind going so far.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi was just going to declare himself willing
to fetch the flower for Stefeli, when the latter
sped away so fast that the boy could not possibly
have caught up with her. Therefore he stayed
seated and as the noonday bell was ringing in the
village below, he forgot everything else in listening
to its sounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is your flower,&#8221; a voice suddenly said
beside him as Stefeli laid a brilliant red cloth
before her brother. Having been lost in deep
thoughts he had not noticed how the time had
passed and he could not wonder enough at
Stefeli&#8217;s speedy return. He meditatively looked
at what he had imagined to be a flower. It had
the same deep red the flower had had, but he could
not help wondering where he had seen that cloth
before. &#8220;Oh, I know now,&#8221; he exclaimed suddenly,
&#8220;I saw it on the chair near Mrs. Troll&#8217;s
house where the little girl was. It must belong
to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stefeli also remembered having seen a red object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
there and besides that she had seen some
children in the party near the bridge. They must
have been the same children. Vinzi began to
consider what to do with the cloth, and as it was
best to immediately return to the owner whatever
was found, he wanted to run right over to Mrs.
Troll&#8217;s house and take it along. But Stefeli
would not hear of this, because dinner time had
come for everyone and there was plenty of time
in which to do it later. As soon as Stefeli mentioned
lunch, Vinzi suddenly felt how immensely
hungry he was and saw that his sister was right.
He set to work and gathering thin, dry sticks
from under the tree, built a little fire and lit it.
As the wood was very dry, the flames leaped up
gaily. Stefeli had transformed the grassy ground
into an appetizing dinner table, set with two large
slices of buttered bread and two snow white eggs
which their mother had cooked at home, and
which only needed peeling. Stefeli brought the
bag near the fire and only waited for the right
moment when the wood had burnt low to put the
clean round potatoes one after another into the
coals. Soon they smoked and sizzled so invitingly
that the children were glad when, with a
willow stick, they could lift them out of the glowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
ashes. As soon as the potatoes had cooled off
a bit, the children heartily bit into them and ate
them all, including the firmly-baked crust, which
was really the best part. They did not despise the
rest of their lunch, and Vinzi attacked his bread
and butter vigorously, while Stefeli heartily enjoyed
her egg. All morning the cows had been
pasturing busily, so the time had come for them
also to rest a bit. One after the other they lay down
on a fine, sunny spot. Even Schwärzeli had
settled down, but her little black head moved from
side to side in a lively manner which showed that
one could not yet quite trust her to be quiet.</p>

<p>The children had neatly cleaned up their place
under the tree, for egg-shells and scraps of paper
were not to be left on the fine green carpet
of their living room. Looking out over the
pasture, they were happily enjoying the deep
peace about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might take the shawl back now,&#8221; said Vinzi
after a while. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think the cows will
stay quiet till I come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so,&#8221; Stefeli replied. &#8220;The big
ones are sure to lie down for a while, and if
Schwärzeli begins to jump about and wants to
run towards the stream, I can lure her here. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
kept the salt mother gave us for our eggs, we
both took none and Schwärzeli just loves it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi took up the red shawl which Stefeli had
neatly folded up and ran away. Despite his
speed it was a good quarter of an hour before
he stood in front of Mrs. Troll&#8217;s house. The
front door was open and everything in the
house was still. Somebody was apparently hoeing
in the garden, it was probably Mrs. Troll
herself. Suddenly, however, quite different
sounds drew the boy irresistibly up the stairs.
Through a half-open door quite near at hand he
caught a delightful, gay melody. Walking up
close he laid his ear on the door to listen. But as
Vinzi, in his desire to hear, had strongly pushed
his head against it, it suddenly flew wide open.
As soon as the little musician, who was sitting on
a high stool before the instrument, saw Vinzi, she
sprang up and went to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, did you find my shawl? How quickly
you have brought it back!&#8221; she called out, spying
the shawl in Vinzi&#8217;s hand. &#8220;It&#8217;s lucky for me
because Miss Landrat has already scolded me for
losing it. As punishment for my carelessness I
was to go all the way back where papa and the
other gentleman took us this morning. I was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
look for it, but as it was so far she refused to go
along. I&#8217;ll give you some reward for finding it.
What would you like to have?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi was still gazing full of surprise at the
wonder-child, who had played such gorgeous
music and was now talking to him exactly as if
she had known him a long, long time. Hesitating
with his answer, he finally asked a little shyly,
&#8220;Can I really say what I want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; his new acquaintance replied
firmly. &#8220;But you know,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;only
ask for something I can really give you, not perhaps
a boat or a real, live horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I don&#8217;t mean anything like that. I
only want to hear the music again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The music? Do you mean the piece I was
playing when you came in? But I don&#8217;t call that
a present. What is your name?&#8221; the girl suddenly
changed her line of thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vinzi,&#8221; he informed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it? My name is Alida Thornau,&#8221; she
continued. &#8220;When I have to practice I find it
so dreadfully tiresome that I always play a
little piece between whiles. Do you have to
practice, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is practicing?&#8221; asked Vinzi.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, you are lucky if you don&#8217;t know what
that is,&#8221; Alida exclaimed. &#8220;You see, practicing
is sitting still on a round stool and playing up
and down on a piano with your hands. This is
called playing scales, and repeating the same
tones about thirty times to and fro is called
finger practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you have to practice?&#8221; asked Vinzi,
wondering deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because one has to obey,&#8221; replied Alida,
&#8220;and I have to practice every day from two to
three o&#8217;clock because Miss Landrat tells me to. I
have no lessons here the way I have in Hamburg.
Every time father comes down here I have to
promise him to obey Miss Landrat. He is up at
the baths with my mother because she is ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you learn to play that beautiful
piece?&#8221; Vinzi inquired, following all her information
with great interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, one can easily do that when one practices
so much and knows the notes. All one has
to do is to play the notes that are written there,&#8221;
was Alida&#8217;s explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are lucky to be allowed to practice
so much,&#8221; said Vinzi, gazing at the piano
with such an expression of longing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Alida suddenly remembered the reward he had
been promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll play you the piece now,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Shut the door and come near to me so that you
can hear it well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi obeyed and expectantly posted himself
behind the piano stool.</p>

<p>With an eagerness never before exhibited,
Alida played her Spring Song through, never
once stopping or hesitating till she came to the
end. Never had such a thing happened before!
To have such a keen listener had made her able
to perform unusually well.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_048fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">VINZI STARED AT HER FINGERS AS IF HER PLAYING WERE A MIRACLE</p>

<p>Vinzi stared at her fingers as if her playing
were a miracle. In a mirror which hung over the
piano Alida had seen how breathlessly he followed
her. This pleased her and when she had
finished the piece she began it all over again. In
the midst of it she suddenly seemed to be struck
by a new idea. She paused abruptly and turning
about on her chair she asked, &#8220;Would you like to
learn how to play the piano?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi&#8217;s eyes sparkled, but only for a moment;
in the next he looked at the floor saying sadly,
&#8220;Oh, I never could do it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you could easily,&#8221; replied Alida<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
with conviction. &#8220;I can teach you and you&#8217;ll
soon know all I know. You can practice with
me and that will be heaps more fun than to sit
and play here all alone. You can play a little
piece like the one you like so much. It won&#8217;t
take you long. Do you want to?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi&#8217;s eyes had grown bigger and bigger
with surprise and longing. The incomprehensible
joy of playing music like that himself, lay
suddenly before him. All he had to do was to say
yes. Everything was to be so easy and perfectly
natural. He could not believe that he might be
granted such happiness.</p>

<p>But his great inner emotion kept him from
uttering a sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you say yes? I am sure you
must want to if you like it so much,&#8221; Alida said
with slight impatience. &#8220;You can come here
every day at two o&#8217;clock because Miss Landrat
always takes a walk with Hugo at that time. I
am supposed to practice till three and sometimes
even longer if they happen to be away. Then
we&#8217;ll be quite alone and I can teach you everything.
We can either play together or take turns.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Vinzi saw it so clearly put before him
it seemed at last possible. With a voice clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
showing his delight he said, &#8220;There is nothing I
should love better in this world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So now it&#8217;s all settled that you come to me
tomorrow,&#8221; said Alida with satisfaction, &#8220;or do
you want to begin today?&#8221;</p>

<p>However anxious Vinzi was to do so, he realized
that he had already stayed away from Stefeli
long enough. But he gladly gave his promise to
come the next day, if nothing prevented him from
doing so. He could hardly yet believe his good
fortune, but Alida&#8217;s sureness about the matter
proved catching and he ran away in high glee.
The thought of what Stefeli would say to the plan
chiefly occupied his mind, as he ran along.
Maybe she would refuse to be left alone each
day and perhaps she would think their father
might be angry if he knew. Therefore he still
felt slightly uncertain.</p>

<p>When he reached the pasture he found everything
in perfect order. The cows were lying on
the self-same spots and Schwärzeli was wandering
quietly about. He ran to Stefeli, who sat
under a tree singing a song.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a long time you have been away,&#8221;
said Stefeli, interrupting her song. &#8220;What did
she say?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>Vinzi, sitting down beside his sister, began to
relate what had happened. She heard of the
joyous prospect Alida had offered him, namely,
to go to her an hour every day to practice. But
he had not yet accepted because he did not know
what Stefeli would say to being left alone for a
whole hour every day.</p>

<p>Stefeli pondered for a moment. &#8220;You can
easily do it, Vinzi,&#8221; she said eagerly. &#8220;I know
that it will please you more than anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I know it, too,&#8221; said Vinzi with
gleaming eyes. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that there
won&#8217;t be much trouble with the cows at that time?
They are still quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There won&#8217;t be any,&#8221; Stefeli reassured him.
&#8220;All the time you were gone they lay still and
looked around. Schwärzeli just walked about
and it is like this every afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi had known it well, but was glad to have
Stefeli&#8217;s confirmation. Vinzi&#8217;s new prospect had
made the children talkative, and they discussed
the coming events and their possible consequences.
They could talk without any interruption,
for the cows were feeding quietly again,
as they were supposed to do. All at once the
sound of horns could be heard from different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
sides, warning them that the time had come to
drive the cattle home to be milked.</p>

<p>Vinzi leaped up with surprise when he realized
how quickly the evening had come. Stefeli took
the bag on her arm and her stick in her hand and
fetched Schwärzeli from where she was wandering
about. Vinzi whistled and called his cows
together and before long the children were on
their way home with the little herd. The father
was already waiting for them near the stable. On
the days when the children had to go to the
pasture with the cows their work was done for the
day when they came home. As soon as their
father returned from the stable they had supper,
and soon after, when the mother had finished her
tasks in the kitchen, she sat down to sing with
them; after this they went to bed, and gladly, too,
knowing that next morning another early start
had to be made.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>UNLOOKED-FOR EVENTS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS soon as Vinzi was awake next morning he
wished it were two o&#8217;clock right away, for
he simply dreaded the long morning he
had to live through before his lesson. But it went
by much more quickly than he expected. A lot
of running about had been necessary to keep the
cows together, as they were always very lively at
that time.</p>

<p>When lunch was over and the cows had settled
down to rest, Vinzi looked steadily towards the
mountains. Suddenly rising from the ground
he said, &#8220;It must be two o&#8217;clock now. Yesterday
the sun was just above that rocky peak when I
got back. In an hour it will be above the peak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Vinzi. The sooner you go the sooner
you&#8217;ll be back. I want to hear all about it,&#8221;
said Stefeli.</p>

<p>Vinzi lost no time. As he was climbing up
the steps at Mrs. Troll&#8217;s he found Alida waiting
for him. &#8220;You came at just the right time,&#8221; she
called to him; &#8220;they are both away and we&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
be entirely alone. You must always come at
this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Vinzi entered the room he glanced
quickly at the clock. &#8220;I know exactly how high
the sun must be when I leave,&#8221; he said with satisfaction.
&#8220;It is just ten minutes after two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s start in now,&#8221; Alida proposed.
&#8220;First, I&#8217;ll tell you what the notes are called, and
next, which of the keys one has to play on. After
that you can begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took up a little sheet of music and began
to teach him. As Alida did not care to linger long
over anything her instruction was rather hurried.
But Vinzi had so attentively followed every word
and had comprehended her so quickly, that his
teacher proceeded as rapidly as she had wished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you the keys now. As soon as you
play a bit you&#8217;ll get to know the notes better,&#8221; she
said. Reading the notes to him had begun to
seem extremely tiresome.</p>

<p>As she taught him the keys, Alida played
them too in order to make the lesson more vivid.</p>

<p>Vinzi could not help wondering profoundly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is the music made?&#8221; he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is already made and printed in the book,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
from which we can read and play it,&#8221; answered
Alida.</p>

<p>&#8220;But hasn&#8217;t somebody made it up before
others can play it?&#8221; asked Vinzi modestly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that one could write down
tunes one hears inside one&#8217;s head, if one only
knew how? Then one could play it all on
the piano.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s not a bit necessary. I am quite
sure that enough music has been written already,&#8221;
Alida said, glancing with a deep sigh at the large
book in which were printed all the exercises she
had to learn.</p>

<p>Vinzi was also looking at it, absolutely absorbed.
The large black dots seemed to him
nothing short of a miracle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll play you the little piece you liked
so much,&#8221; Alida continued. &#8220;Soon you&#8217;ll be able
to play it, too. It is awfully easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi&#8217;s eyes glowed as he listened. He drank
it in with all his senses.</p>

<p>Just as Alida had reached the end the black-forest
clock on the wall struck three.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lesson is over, but come again tomorrow,&#8221;
said Alida jumping up from her chair.</p>

<p>Shaking hands, Vinzi quickly hurried away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Three days passed in the same way. Vinzi
proved such an apt pupil that his teacher could
not help wondering at his progress. He had
played the little piece through once, for he knew
it by heart. Reading the notes still gave him
trouble. When he had played it only with his
index finger, Alida was much shocked. She forbade
him ever to play that way again. No human
being played like that, she said, for all five fingers
of the hand were meant to be used in playing.
But it had seemed a much easier way to Vinzi.
In the end he saw how much better her way was
as it was too difficult for the left hand to
move quickly.</p>

<p>Vinzi was grateful for being sent to the
pasture every day. It would have been hard for
him to work with his father in the barn or stable,
because his thoughts were so completely filled
with his new studies that it always took him a
moment to comprehend what people were saying
to him. Once in a while when his father had
needed him for little tasks he had shaken his head.
&#8220;Well, where is your head nowadays, boy?&#8221; he
had said as he sent him off.</p>

<p>The day had come for the fourth lesson. In
happy anticipation Vinzi had been running and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
was already half way up the stairs, when a sharp
voice called to him from below, &#8220;Hey there, what
does this mean? Come straight down, you forward
boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only going up to Alida,&#8221; said Vinzi a
little frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, to Alida? You know no Alida here,
and she does not know you, either,&#8221; Mrs. Troll
cried out indignantly. &#8220;Come down this minute
or I&#8217;ll fetch you down myself in a way you won&#8217;t
like at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi went down the stairs obediently, but
not without calling out with all his might, &#8220;Alida,
I am not allowed to come to you. But I want
you to know that I was here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you saying?&#8221; said the woman
furiously. &#8220;I see, you meant to fool me and
make me think that you know the little girl whose
name you happened to hear once? Look, here is
the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Alida, who had heard him, now came running
down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you send Vinzi away? He came
to see me,&#8221; she said in a superior tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see, the matter was arranged beforehand,&#8221;
said Mrs. Troll, but she used quite a different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
tone of voice now. &#8220;Does Miss Landrat
know that he was expected?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I know,&#8221; Alida answered
obstinately.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we tell Miss Landrat the matter will be
settled,&#8221; Mrs. Troll said with a shade of sarcasm.
&#8220;But the best he can do now is to go where
he belongs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi couldn&#8217;t help agreeing to that. Giving
Alida his hand, he went sadly away with the conviction
that everything was now over. Alida
was filled with rage that the woman should be
allowed to send her dear friend away like that.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell father everything,&#8221; she cried out
passionately, &#8220;and he won&#8217;t have Vinzi treated
that way again.&#8221; Her anger giving her wings,
she flew up the stairs.</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Troll saw Miss Landrat approaching
with Hugo she went out quickly and
gave a thorough report of what had happened.
&#8220;It is quite evident that the boy has been
here before,&#8221; she concluded her tale excitedly.
&#8220;Everything was planned, for he shot up the
stairs as if he were perfectly at home here. The
girl was apparently waiting for him upstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governess was simply petrified.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>&#8220;How could Alida presume to do such a
thing? The idea of making friends with a cow-herd
whose father we know nothing about,&#8221; she
cried out with indignation. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to tell
her parents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be the boy who found her shawl,&#8221;
said Hugo, who had kept quiet till then. &#8220;We
saw him on Sunday with his sister. He looked
very nice, and I don&#8217;t see why Alida shouldn&#8217;t
be friends with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Landrat had no words left to show her
disapproval; turning about she went up the
stairs. Hugo followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who came here while we were gone?&#8221; asked
the governess, throwing open the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vinzi,&#8221; replied Alida.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is the boy&#8217;s name who was here, I
should like to know what brought him here,&#8221; continued
the lady in great agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;He came to take a music lesson,&#8221; was the
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I am joking, Alida,&#8221; said
Miss Landrat, still more furious.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; replied the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you please give me a sensible answer!&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
exclaimed the governess. &#8220;Why did it ever occur
to you to ask the boy here? What did he want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wanted his music lesson,&#8221; replied Alida,
as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why don&#8217;t you tell me who wanted to
give him a music lesson,&#8221; Hugo interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was to give it,&#8221; Alida replied seriously.</p>

<p>Hugo exploded with laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he laugh at the idea of your giving
him a music lesson?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he was very attentive,&#8221; said Alida.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is enough!&#8221; exclaimed the governess
angrily. &#8220;Do not ask anything more, Hugo.
Alida is wrong if she thinks it funny to invent
such rubbish. I shall write to your papa at
once. But before everything else I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221; with
this she left the room.</p>

<p>Hugo renewed his examination now. He
heard to his great amusement that she had given
Vinzi several lessons and that he had already
learned much. Alida also wanted her brother to
know that she fully meant to tell her papa how
Vinzi had been treated by Mrs. Troll.</p>

<p>In the meantime Miss Landrat had sought
out Mrs. Troll. She told her to send Vinzi away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
if he ever should venture near the house again,
and roundly to forbid him entering it.</p>

<p>The same evening Vinzi&#8217;s father passed Mrs.
Troll&#8217;s house as he cut across the field on his way
home. As she happened to be in her garden at
the time she called out to him. &#8220;Hey there!
neighbor Lesa, I have something to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;if it would not
be better for your boy if he had something to do,
instead of running into other people&#8217;s houses and
getting into mischief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, neighbor?&#8221; asked
Lesa, pressing his lips together.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask what I mean? Well, your boy has
been here several times to amuse the little girl
who boards here. They play music together and
such stuff,&#8221; said Mrs. Troll. &#8220;But the governess
won&#8217;t hear of it and the boy must stay where he
belongs from now on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll stay there safe enough; good-bye,&#8221;
said Lesa, going his way.</p>

<p>At supper time he came home. Both children
were seated at the table, because the mother liked
to have everything ready for her husband. She
immediately brought in the supper and sat down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
too. But he said nothing. Once in a while the
mother looked questioningly at him, but as he
took no notice she realized that something must
have happened. Her husband apparently wished
to be alone. Therefore as soon as the meal was
done and she had finished the necessary tasks, the
children were sent to bed. When Lesa found
himself alone with his wife he said to her, &#8220;Sit
down, I must talk to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did as she was bid.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had enough of the boy now,&#8221; he began
in quite a temper. &#8220;It is not enough that he
does nothing, understands nothing, and can&#8217;t be
good for anything on the farm; now he even has
to bring shame and dishonor upon us. This is the
end now and I&#8217;ve made up my mind to send
him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman had grown pale with fright.</p>

<p>&#8220;But for heaven&#8217;s sake, what has Vinzi
done?&#8221; she asked anxiously. &#8220;It is not a bit
like him. What did he do, Vinzenz? Please tell
me; did he really do some wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask him yourself what he has done. It is
enough for me to have to hear from a neighbor
that it would be better for my boy to have something
to do instead of running into other people&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
houses and fooling around. That a thing like
that should be said to me! Matters have gone on
long enough now, and this is the end. I am
simply going to send him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his agitation Vinzenz Lesa had risen from
his chair but after walking once across the room,
he came back to his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand what has happened,&#8221;
said the woman, when he was sitting beside her
again, after she had been able to think a little.
&#8220;It certainly is not Vinzi&#8217;s way to go into
people&#8217;s houses without a cause; there must have
been a reason. Let us first talk to the boy and
ask him why he did it, for it is not fair to judge
him otherwise. He is sure to tell us the truth.
But think, Vinzenz, what it would be to send
away a twelve year old boy! He is much too
young for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t stop you from talking to him,&#8221; replied
the husband, &#8220;but one thing is clear. He
simply has to go. I have thought of it for a long
while and now the time has come. He must go
to a place where there is no possible chance for
him to hear such nonsense. He must go where
there are few people, but the kind who get full
pleasure from their work. I mean people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
stay by themselves and who do not sit together
with strangers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the first thing of all should be to know
the people,&#8221; the wife interrupted eagerly. &#8220;I
hope you do not mean to send Vinzi to the first
person who happens to like his work on a farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy, easy, I am coming to that,&#8221; the man
continued in a calm voice. &#8220;You know that I
went up to the Simplon last fall where a cousin of
mine, Lorenz Lesa, lives. Well, he has a fine
farm with a few splendid cows, and though it
isn&#8217;t big, everything is in excellent order. I liked
it up there and I&#8217;ll send the boy to him. Vinzi
may still come out all right if he sees other boys
who are happy and content in that kind of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it really possible that you mean to send
the boy so far away!&#8221; cried out the woman with a
wail, &#8220;so high up into the mountains? It must
be dreadfully lonely up there. I can&#8217;t even
imagine what things would be like. I don&#8217;t know
either your cousin or his wife. How could they
be expected to receive the boy? You send him to
them like a good-for-nothing with whom one can
do nothing more at home. It would seem as if
our Vinzi had become a criminal who had to be
sent into banishment.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>&#8220;You need not get excited, woman,&#8221; retorted
the man, &#8220;the change is not to be a punishment
but a means of bringing him around. My cousin
Lorenz is a good, sensible man who won&#8217;t treat
him badly, and Cousin Josepha is a splendid
woman who is bringing up her three boys in such
a way that it gives one pleasure to look at them.
I saw them right in the midst of their cows and I
never heard such singing and jokes and such
cracking of whips. They seem to have an eternal
holiday. Don&#8217;t you believe yourself that our boy
might change in such surroundings and realize
how lucky he is to have been born to be a farmer?
Nothing better could possibly happen to him than
to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman said nothing more, but she was
far from convinced that Vinzi would feel at home
among boys so different. She could not help
wondering what the cousins would think of
Vinzi&#8217;s rather odd ways. Many other thoughts
disturbed her, but she knew how useless they
were. Of course Vinzi had to go and she knew
no other place to send him to. She asked her
husband how soon they could hear whether their
relations would take the boy, and when Vinzi
would have to leave them. So her husband told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
her that he had clearly shown Lorenz how he
liked the boys and had admitted how much he
wished his boy were happy and bright, too, instead
of being so dreamy. Lorenz had asked him
then and there to send Vinzi to him for a summer
whenever he wanted to. In the gay company of
the other boys he might wake up. Lorenz also
promised to do his share, as happy boys appealed
to him much more than obstinate ones.</p>

<p>So it had been settled between them that Vinzi
was to go and that in return one of the three boys
was to spend a summer with them. It would do
him good to see a new place and different ways of
working. Lesa believed that a man who lived in
the valley was soon going to drive his cattle over
the mountain and that would give them a good
opportunity to send Vinzi.</p>

<p>The mother went to bed with a heavy heart
that night. Vinzi was to be sent to perfect
strangers into surroundings she did not know.
Besides it was so far away that she could not even
keep an eye on him. Why did it have to be?
Another great sorrow was the thought that Vinzi
must have done something to draw his father&#8217;s
discontent upon him. She hardly slept that
night. As soon as it had grown bright the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
morning and before anyone in the house had
wakened, she went into Vinzi&#8217;s chamber. She
wanted to have a quiet hour with the boy in order
to hear what he had done. She also had to prepare
him for what was to happen, for she realized
that it would probably be very soon. Vinzi, opening
his large, dark eyes, gazed with surprise at his
mother. She was sitting on the edge of his bed,
holding his hand in hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Vinzi,&#8221; she began, &#8220;while nobody
can disturb us, why you made father so angry
yesterday. You had better tell me everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi had to think a little. He remembered
how furiously Mrs. Troll had sent him away the
day before and he supposed his father had heard
about it. He told her the whole incident of the
music lessons and how raging Mrs. Troll had
grown, also how desirous Alida had been to continue
the lessons.</p>

<p>A great load fell from the mother&#8217;s heart
when she found that Vinzi had done no wrong.
She understood, however, that their neighbor&#8217;s
words had specially irritated her husband, because
Vinzi had for a long while caused him
secret anxiety and grief. She found it necessary
to explain to her boy, how wrong it had been to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
tell her nothing of the matter. She wondered if
it had not occurred to him that nothing like that
should have been begun without telling them at
home. Vinzi here quite frankly admitted that he
had been afraid of not getting his father&#8217;s permission,
and as he had been so dreadfully eager to
learn something about music, he and Stefeli had
talked it all over and had decided that it was a
good time to leave the pasture. They had
thought their father would not mind so long
as nothing happened to the cows. But the mother
said that his secrecy had not been right and was
bringing bad consequences, though she hoped
these might also lead to good. Here she spoke of
his father&#8217;s plan and their hope that Vinzi would
learn to enjoy all the farm work his three cousins
seemed to relish so much. She hoped he would
heartily enter into everything with them and
return bright and happy; which would make
his father overjoyed. However delicately the
mother had mentioned their decision, Vinzi had
only heard the fact that he had to leave his home.
The boy looked terror-stricken, but did not utter
a word. The mother was glad enough that he
did not complain, because his frightened face
alone had brought the tears to her eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>Everything took its usual course that day.
The children went up to the pasture again, and
the cows, after they wandered about for a bit,
had quietly settled down. Stefeli was quite accustomed
to Vinzi&#8217;s long silent spells, when he
seemed to listen to all kinds of sounds she could
not hear. But that day he went too far.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say something to me, Vinzi. You might
just as well not be here at all,&#8221; she finally said a
little crossly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, and I won&#8217;t be here much longer. I
can&#8217;t help thinking of your being all alone when
I can&#8217;t come to the pasture any more,&#8221; Vinzi said
dolefully. Then Stefeli heard that he was to be
sent up to a high mountain, to people he had
never seen. She could not believe that anything
so unheard-of could suddenly come to pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;When will you have to go?&#8221; she asked,
wholly overcome by this dreadful change.</p>

<p>As his mother had not mentioned this, Vinzi
did not know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am glad,&#8221; she cried out decidedly relieved,
&#8220;it may not be for quite a while. And if
it is put off a long while, it may never happen at
all. Cheer up again, Vinzi.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stefeli had a way of finding a consoling side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to everything and had often brightened Vinzi&#8217;s
despondent mood by her cheerful outlook. That
day also the boy was affected by her words, and
the sunny afternoon ended much more happily
than it had begun.</p>

<p>When the children had gone to bed and the
parents were sitting alone together Lesa told his
wife that he had gone to the village that day and
that when he had asked after his friend he had
found that the latter had just that day driven
his cows over the mountain. But there was no
loss in that; on the contrary. He had at the same
time heard of a young workman from Gondo who
was going home to his village next Monday. As
he would make the road from Brieg on foot, he
expected to spend the night in Berisal on the way.
This was much better, as Vinzi would not be
obliged to make the whole journey on foot. Lesa
also knew an innkeeper in Berisal who would
provide good board for the travellers.</p>

<p>The woman, who had listened silently till now,
here said, &#8220;How can you give our boy in charge
of a person nobody knows anything about, except
that he is going up the mountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I immediately went to see him and talked it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
all over,&#8221; replied the father, &#8220;and I found him a
good fellow. When I inquired about him I
heard nothing but good of him. All Vinzi needs
is to have a companion, for he can look after himself
perfectly well. No boy is a little child any
more at twelve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young enough, to go away alone,&#8221; uttered
the mother with a sigh. &#8220;Does he really have
to go on Monday? Tomorrow is Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing could be better,&#8221; the husband said
decisively. &#8220;If a thing has to be done, it is best
to have it settled right away. I can&#8217;t see anything
dreadful in it. He is not going to Australia,
and next winter he&#8217;ll be home again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a blessing that we can give him into the
protection of our Father in Heaven. I find this
my only consolation now when the boy goes away,
and I don&#8217;t even know the people he is going to,&#8221;
said Mrs. Lesa.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is quite true,&#8221; the husband replied,
happy at the thought that his wife had found a
consolation. &#8220;I think everything is all right
now,&#8221; he said after a pause, pushing his pipe
from one corner of his mouth to the other. But
something still seemed to be on his mind. &#8220;I
think the boy ought to be told about going.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&#8220;He knows, for I told him this morning; only
I didn&#8217;t know when.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man found this information very welcome.
Vinzi had known all day what was to
happen to him and he had retained his composure.
As Lesa had anticipated a flood of tears, he was
very glad to be spared a scene.</p>

<p>Next day the afternoon sun was shining down
upon the bench before Lesa&#8217;s house when he took
his seat there as usual and called to Vinzi to come
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that you are to go to our cousin&#8217;s
on the mountain,&#8221; he began when the boy was
sitting beside him. &#8220;It is beautiful there and
you&#8217;ll soon like it. You are going there for your
own good and I hope you&#8217;ll remember to do honor
to your parents. Your fellow-traveller knows
the house you are to go to. You are expected
there, though they do not know the exact day of
your coming. All you have to tell them is
who you are. Just say that I sent you as I
planned to do. You leave early tomorrow morning
with a man who knows the way and has exact
instructions.&#8221;</p>

<p>The father was decidedly pleased when Vinzi
said not a word. To give the boy courage he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
vividly described the gay life of his young cousins
in the midst of their lively mountain cattle. The
mother in the meantime packed the little bag
Vinzi was to take on his back.</p>

<p>Stefeli had heard from her mother what was
to happen the next morning and as she noted that
her questions proved unwelcome she said nothing.
There was still less chance of having questions
answered by her father who was now talking to
Vinzi. Poor Stefeli felt quite lost and followed
her mother about, hoping that the time would
come soon when she could talk again.</p>

<p>The bag was packed and a very silent supper
had been eaten. The mother seemed completely
unable to utter a syllable. She was very anxious
to control her grief in order not to make it harder
for the boy, but she must say a few words to him
that night when he was in bed. All was dark
when she went to his little room and sat down at
his bed-side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you came, mother,&#8221; he said immediately.
&#8220;I am a little frightened. Do you
think my uncle will be cross when I forget to
mind the cows? Stefeli always called to me when
she needed me if I was not paying attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, as I never saw either your aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
or your uncle,&#8221; replied the mother. &#8220;But I want
to beg of you, Vinzi, to do your very best to please
them. If they should complain of you, or feel
obliged to send you home, your father could not
bear it. Never do anything that would prevent
you from looking cheerfully up to your good
Father in Heaven, for you can always look to him
when you feel afraid or lonely. You can tell
Him everything, for He is always above you and
can see and hear you. Don&#8217;t forget that, Vinzi,
and may this thought be your greatest comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi promised never to forget her words.
With this she left him.</p>

<p>In the very early morning the father accompanied
Vinzi down to the station where his
fellow-traveller was waiting. After the train had
carried them across the valley to Brieg, they were
to take to the road which led to the mountain.</p>

<small>A DEPARTURE AND AN ARRIVAL</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MR. THORNAU, who was staying with
his sick wife at the baths of Leuk had
just received two letters. One was from
his daughter, and one from the children&#8217;s governess.
Both letters expressed an urgent desire to
see him as soon as possible as the writers wished to
speak to him. He felt no particular joy at the
complete harmony of their wishes, because he
knew that this usually resulted from a great difference
of opinion. Laying the letters on his
wife&#8217;s bed, he said, &#8220;They&#8217;ve asked me to come to
them again, and it is sure to be some matter I have
to settle with Miss Landrat. Don&#8217;t be alarmed,
though, for worrying might hurt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Thornau could see that his wife was
agitated as she murmered to herself, &#8220;I wish we
had not sent the children away, it is not good for
them. They should be here with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want them here, Alida,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;you only need to say so, and I&#8217;ll fetch them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
But you know that I installed them there to give
you the quiet you ought to have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be more quiet if you bring them,&#8221; replied
she. &#8220;Apparently they are not very happy.
The governess may mean well, but she is too
strict; which shows that she does not understand
children. She uses the greatest severity when it
is not necessary. I see that Hugo grows more
quiet and reserved and Alida more obstinate and
head-strong, despite her best intentions. Neither
of them is easy to handle, as you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; the husband agreed. &#8220;Alida
has my temperament and being a girl, needs
specially good guidance. Nature has curiously
changed things, for Hugo needs special care,
too. He has inherited your temperament and
delicate health.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he too needs special consideration,&#8221; the
mother added. &#8220;Please promise me always to
treat him affectionately. He will stand in such
need of it, especially when I am no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But for heaven&#8217;s sake, Alida, do not think
of such a thing, and let us never say another word
about it!&#8221; Mr. Thornau cried out. &#8220;I&#8217;ll start
right off to settle this new law-suit. I shall walk
there, because the road is charming. It will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
take two hours, but I&#8217;ll probably take a carriage
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Thornau was quietly chuckling to himself
as he strolled down the mountain. He clearly
recollected the last case he had had to arbitrate.
Alida, while practicing, had rather urgently
banged the innocent keys to make them feel how
little to her taste it was to have to spend her time
with them. Miss Landrat had given her a well-earned
scolding, but had unfortunately grown
violently angry. Suddenly Alida had pressed
both hands on her mouth to keep herself from
bursting out laughing. &#8220;Why are you laughing?&#8221;
Miss Landrat had asked, still more angry.
Alida shortly declared she could not tell why.
On being asked three times more, she repeated
the same answer. Finally the governess absolutely
commanded her to tell the truth and she
was reminded of her duty to obey. Alida knew
that she must do so and therefore she informed
the questioner that her face had grown so pointed
while she was scolding her that she had resembled
a drawing in her natural history book. She had
suddenly thought her governess&#8217;s name might
really be Miss Landrat.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> This impertinence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
was reported to her father, but Alida vigorously
objected that she had not meant to be impertinent
in the least. As her father had ordered her to
obey, she could not do otherwise. The father had
really found it a rather hard case to settle.</p>

<p>Mr. Thornau reached Mrs. Troll&#8217;s house.
The door was violently thrown open and Alida,
who had spied her father, came rushing out. At
the first moment of their greeting a whole stream
of information about the event in question came
pouring from her lips. But the father checked
her. &#8220;Miss Landrat will be heard first; your
turn comes next,&#8221; he said. He kept his word
and first got one version, which was followed by a
vivid second from his daughter. Alida fully
described Mrs. Troll&#8217;s horrid behavior to Vinzi
when she had sent him off. Hugo figured as
witness and assured his father that Vinzi was a
charming looking boy and not a common street
boy by any means. He boldly stated that he
would much rather associate with Vinzi than with
Mrs. Troll.</p>

<p>The father never doubted that his daughter&#8217;s
sudden enthusiasm for music had an extraordinary
cause. But this was not the most important
point. He felt that the boy who had so honestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
returned his daughter&#8217;s property, and had been
invited by her to return to the house, had been
treated most insultingly. He felt anxious to
offer some kind of reparation and decided to pay
a little call on the boy and his parents and to
apologize for what had happened. They might
give the boy a small present as a reward for returning
the shawl. Full of joy Alida offered to
act as guide, as Vinzi had told her where he lived
and how to get there. They had no trouble finding
Lesa&#8217;s house as a slightly curving path which
led across the big meadow took them there in the
shortest time. Everything round about was
quiet, with the exception of peaceful cackling
sounds from the farm-yard. The house looked
most tidy. The lawn was newly mowed, the road
was swept, and the bench in the shade of the walnut
tree seemed to have been polished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like the looks of this place,&#8221; said Mr.
Thornau, glancing about with satisfaction.
&#8220;Too bad, too, bad,&#8221; he added. The last words
he had murmered to himself, but Alida had heard
and interpreted them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you mean it is too bad we don&#8217;t live
here, papa?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;But we could easily
move here, as our piano is only rented. Vinzi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
could practice with me every day. Then I&#8217;d
really enjoy it. You know, papa, it is dreadfully
stupid to learn alone. That&#8217;s why I gave him
lessons; it made him practice, too. He is so
clever that he&#8217;ll soon learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The father burst into a laugh. &#8220;I see the
reason for the music lessons now! Excellent!
Did you say your pupil was anxious to learn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, and he was so clever, too,&#8221; exclaimed
Alida. &#8220;Just think, papa, when I explained
anything to him he usually understood
it better than I did and afterwards was able to
explain it all to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The father could not help smiling as he approached
the door, which was unfastened.</p>

<p>Mr. Thornau, entering the hall, knocked on
the first door. In answer to a call from within
he went into a large bright room. Mrs. Lesa was
sitting near the window with some sewing and
Stefeli in front of her. The little girl&#8217;s small
fingers were with difficulty holding several thick
knitting-needles; the coarse thread was wound
six times around her index-finger. The woman
rose at once and met her visitors. Mr. Thornau,
introducing himself, gave her to understand that
he had come to express his sincere regret for what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Mrs. Troll had said to Vinzi. He knew that the
boy had brought back Alida&#8217;s property and had
been invited by Alida to come again. He also
hoped that he and his children would be able to
tell Vinzi themselves how sorry they were about
Mrs. Troll&#8217;s unkind words. He wondered if he
would accept some friendly attention from them
in gratitude for finding the shawl. Mrs. Lesa
did not know what Mrs. Troll&#8217;s words had been,
for Vinzi had not repeated them. She realized
what must have happened, however, and it came
into her mind that Mrs. Troll&#8217;s remarks to her
husband had occasioned Vinzi&#8217;s immediate removal
from home. He had left only that morning
and all the mother&#8217;s thoughts had been
engrossed by his going. Begging the gentleman
to take a seat she told him where Vinzi had
been sent.</p>

<p>Alida, rushing up to Stefeli, asked her impetuously,
&#8220;Where is your brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has gone away,&#8221; was Stefeli&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you not on the pasture? I thought
you always stayed on the pasture till he comes
back,&#8221; said Alida, evidently well informed on the
matter. &#8220;If you were there you would not have
to knit such a heavy stocking.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>&#8220;Vinzi has not gone for but an hour; he has
gone for weeks and weeks. That&#8217;s why somebody
else will have to take care of the cows now,
but we don&#8217;t know who is to attend to them yet,&#8221;
Stefeli replied. &#8220;You see I couldn&#8217;t possibly
do it all alone. I couldn&#8217;t manage them if they
were all jumping around at once. But mother
told me that all bad things have a good side, too.
She thought I couldn&#8217;t spend my time better than
knitting woolen stockings for Vinzi to wear when
he comes home again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say that that decidedly belonged to
the very worst side of all,&#8221; replied Alida quickly.
&#8220;Those thick needles are hurting you and the
heavy thread is cutting into your finger. Won&#8217;t
you show me your barnyard? I can hear the
funny little noises the chickens are making.
Can&#8217;t you come out with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stefeli looked towards her mother, who had
heard what the children were saying. With a
nod Stefeli was given permission, and the girls
ran out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure the boy wants to go, too,&#8221; said
Mrs. Lesa, glancing towards Hugo, who had
posted himself shyly behind his father&#8217;s chair.
&#8220;The air would do him good.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, Hugo, you can go and see the place,&#8221;
remarked the father. &#8220;Look how those two are
running, or rather flying about. Go and run
about with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hugo obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I have understood you rightly, Mrs.
Lesa,&#8221; Mr. Thornau continued the interrupted
conversation, &#8220;the boy has been sent away because
he shows no interest in your fine, prosperous
farm and has evidently no inclination for
his future life&#8217;s work. But I cannot believe him
to be a dull boy, for he seems to have been tremendously
eager to take music lessons from
my daughter. According to her he showed the
most extraordinary comprehension.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, he is not dull,&#8221; replied Mrs. Lesa
with animation, &#8220;the trouble with him is that he
has his thoughts where they ought not to be. If
he happens to be out in the field with his father
and he hears the sound of a bell anywhere he
drops everything and pays attention to absolutely
nothing else till no sound of it can be heard
any more. Very often when no one else can
hear anything he seems to be listening to something.
Naturally his father gets impatient with
him. He thought that if Vinzi lived for a while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
with boys who love farm life he might change
and get to like it, too. But I don&#8217;t know how
it will work out,&#8221; added Mrs. Lesa with a
wistful shake of the head. &#8220;These things are so
deeply rooted in Vinzi. When he was a baby he
would stand stock-still at hearing a beautiful
sound. Whenever he got hurt and was crying,
I only had to take him on my lap and sing him a
song to make him happy and quiet again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear Mrs. Lesa, all this clearly
shows that your boy has an ear for music and a
real devotion to it, together with natural talent,&#8221;
Mr. Thornau said eagerly. &#8220;Did you never
think of having his talent developed? The boy
and you, too, might reap the greatest happiness
that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know what the gentleman means,&#8221;
answered Mrs. Lesa with a questioning look.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I mean? Your boy might be sent to
a music school where they could judge his talent.
He could study there. It takes years, of course,
but what of that? If he turns out to be a finished
musician he would be happy and satisfied, and
you, too, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing for Vinzi,&#8221; said Mrs. Lesa
deliberately. &#8220;His father would not consent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
He would never let his only son leave home for
years and years. He would not let him live
among strangers for such a reason, and it would
be altogether too uncertain a future for the boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t the world strange?&#8221; exclaimed Mr.
Thornau. &#8220;Just look at my boy! He is my
only son, too. He only needs to say what he
wants and I give it to him. He may study what
he pleases, and it makes me happy to let him. But
what do you think? If I ask him, &#8216;Would you
like riding horseback?&#8217; he answers, &#8216;No, I&#8217;d
rather not.&#8217; Should I ask him if he wants to
learn to play the violin, or the piano, or the flute,
all he says is, &#8216;No, I&#8217;d rather not.&#8217; &#8216;Would you
like to become a sailor and go far across the sea
into foreign countries?&#8217; He always says, &#8216;Oh, no,
father, I&#8217;d rather not,&#8217; and that is the answer I
get every time. I cannot help being envious of
your son who has such a decided inclination
for music.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa had watched Hugo for quite a
while through the open window. Leaning against
a tree, he was staring indifferently before him.
The two girls in the meanwhile were playing tag,
shrieking violently whenever they were caught,
and then eagerly beginning again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>&#8220;He probably is not very strong,&#8221; she said
sympathetically. &#8220;He looks pale and thin. He
would get stronger if he could live a while on
the pasture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose that would do him good,&#8221;
replied Mr. Thornau. &#8220;He never was very
hardy and now he seems more frail than ever.
Since my wife was taken ill and the boy had to
be separated from her, all the life seems to have
gone out of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you let him stay with his
mother?&#8221; Mrs. Lesa inquired. Her voice clearly
showed an interest, as if it were a matter of great
importance to herself and as if her visitor were an
old friend of hers.</p>

<p>Mr. Thornau smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a real mother, Mrs. Lesa, even for
children that are not your own. I like that. But
you see, my wife has been ordered a complete rest.
So I had to send the children away. If the boy is
allowed to be with his mother, the girl wants to
be with her, too, and she is by nature very noisy&mdash;of
course she can&#8217;t help it. But the mother wants
her children back for she worries about them
more when they are absent. But I think my
visit has been long enough, Mrs. Lesa,&#8221; said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Thornau, getting up. &#8220;Please permit me to
come again, for I like your home extremely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa accompanied her guest outside and
called the children. Hugo was still leaning
against the tree, but when the girls came running
forward he slowly followed. When Stefeli heard
that her mother had invited Mr. Thornau to come
again, she said quickly, &#8220;You must be sure to
come, too, Alida. I might be up on the pasture
then, and you could see what it is like there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alida promised to return, and after taking
leave, Mr. Thornau and the children wandered
back to Mrs. Troll&#8217;s house. As she appeared in
the doorway just then, Mr. Thornau immediately
informed her that the children were leaving her in
a few days. Their mother wanted them back
sooner than he had expected to take them home,
but he promised her to fulfill his obligations. The
chief reason for their going, though, was that he
wished no one to suffer for an act of courtesy
shown his children.</p>

<p>How changed Mr. Thornau was of a sudden,
Mrs. Troll thought to herself. He had turned
from her so abruptly, he who had always been so
courteous and friendly. He really meant to take
the children away. Of course he would never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
bring them back. And all on account of that
miserable boy across the way. It was really
laughable. However, Mrs. Troll was not in a
mood to laugh at all. Now when it was too late
she would willingly have taken back the harsh
words she had said to Vinzi.</p>

<p>Just then the carriage Mr. Thornau had
ordered drove up. Alida, close at her father&#8217;s
side, extracted a triple promise from him that he
would soon take them away. When the carriage
started she had to let him go. Lost in deep
thought, Mr. Thornau drove down the mountain-side.
His impression of Mrs. Lesa and her
household had been extremely pleasant, and he
wished he had known the woman before he had
placed his children elsewhere. She might have
been justified in feeling deep resentment against
them, as the boy had really been banished on their
account, but not a trace of such feeling had she
shown. He also decided to let his daughter discontinue
her music study. He was sure that if
she had real love for music it would show itself in
some other way. Suddenly Mr. Thornau was
greeted by a wanderer going in the same direction
and in whom he recognized his table-companion
from the hotel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Delrick, what a hermit you are!&#8221;
he called out, ordering his carriage to stop. &#8220;If
you refuse to get into my carriage I shall think
that my company is not good enough for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick politely thanked him for the
offer, but said that he was unwilling to give up
his daily walk even for such good company.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! then I&#8217;ll join you,&#8221; said Mr.
Thornau, jumping out of the carriage. &#8220;I am
sure what I have to say will interest you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick smiled, and the two men walked
along side by side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not smile in such an incredulous way,&#8221;
continued Mr. Thornau. &#8220;Do you really intend
to turn your back on society and live alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not quite so bad as that,&#8221; Mr. Delrick
answered with a smile, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t mind admitting
that I should leave the hotel if I could
find a pleasant home with simple upright people
to stay in. I should enjoy nature much
more there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have found the very house for you,&#8221; said
Mr. Thornau triumphantly. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I
was going to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then related his experiences of the day
and described his new acquaintance, Mrs. Lesa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
with great enthusiasm. The deep peace of the
surroundings and the unusual order and cleanliness
in the house and garden, barn and stable
would make anybody long to live there. &#8220;Enough,
Mr. Delrick,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;It certainly is
the home for you. I really feel very unselfish
telling you this, because we shall be the losers if
you leave us. But strangely enough, one cannot
help doing you a favor. You win people&#8217;s hearts
in spite of themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Thornau,&#8221; said his companion,
patting him on the shoulder, &#8220;you are kind indeed
to take pity on a poor unpractical hermit.
I feel ever so grateful to you. Your description
has awakened a keen desire in me to take a look
at the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point a beautiful path joined the road.
Though much longer it repaid by the very fine
views to be had from several spots. As Mr.
Delrick wanted to walk home that way, the
friends separated and Mr. Thornau again
climbed into his carriage.</p>

<p>When Vinzenz Lesa came out of the house
next day to look after his business on the farm,
he noticed a stranger, who was apparently seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
someone. As soon as the latter saw the
farmer, he approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does this house by any chance belong to a
Mr. Lesa?&#8221; he asked politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I have the honor of speaking to the
owner of it?&#8221; asked the stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am lucky to find you, Mr. Lesa. I&#8217;d like
to do some business with you. My name is
Delrick, and I came from Dresden. I am stopping
in the baths of Leuk, where there are too
many people for my taste. As I want to stay in
the neighborhood, I am looking for a quiet home
to live in for a few weeks. When Mr. Thornau
told me about yours I came to see it myself. I
cannot help wishing that you would take me as
a boarder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I live here with my wife and child and I
take in no strangers,&#8221; Mr. Lesa replied curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; Mr. Delrick answered
pleasantly. &#8220;If I were in your place I&#8217;d do
the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lesa could not help looking at the stranger
in astonishment. &#8220;I suppose then that our business
is settled?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>&#8220;I am afraid so,&#8221; replied Mr. Delrick, &#8220;but
I wish you could tell me another house where I
could live. One as much like yours as possible,
just as well situated and surrounded by such
mighty trees. You have a picked estate, Mr.
Lesa, and I realize that I can&#8217;t expect to find
such order and care anywhere else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Lesa was visibly pleased that the gentleman
had eyes enough to see that his home was
kept differently from many others. But his wife
really merited most of the praise for the condition
of the yard and garden. He could not help thinking
of her, sitting in the house and worrying
about her boy. By now Vinzi had probably
reached his cousins on the mountain. She had
hardly spoken a word all day, and he was sorry
for her. It might be a good plan to take this
gentleman into the house to fill her loss. She
had thought before of getting a room ready for
boarders and as the stranger had made a most
agreeable impression on him he felt not at all
averse to the idea of spending his free evenings
with such a man.</p>

<p>After reflecting he answered, &#8220;I can&#8217;t really
think of any other place. But you might go in
and speak to my wife&mdash;if she should agree to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
you I won&#8217;t have any objections. May I attend
to my work now?&#8221;</p>

<p>With this he offered his hand in farewell.</p>

<p>At this unexpected turn Mr. Delrick was
most happy and surprised. Holding Lesa&#8217;s
hand in his a moment he asked, &#8220;Do I understand
you right, Mr. Lesa? Will you really be
satisfied with whatever your wife decides to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll be satisfied,&#8221; Lesa answered before
turning about.</p>

<p>When Mr. Delrick&#8217;s knocking had been
answered by a response to come in, he entered the
room. The child was there alone, knitting a
heavy stocking at the window. Going up to
Stefeli, he asked the little one to call her mother
as he wanted to speak to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;ll soon be here. When she heard
you knocking she went to her room because she
was crying a little,&#8221; said Stefeli.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am sorry. Has something sad happened
that your mother has to cry?&#8221; asked
the stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, because Vinzi has gone away for all
summer and she doesn&#8217;t even know the people he
is living with,&#8221; Stefeli went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Vinzi your brother?&#8221; the gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
asked, full of sympathy. &#8220;Why did he have to
go away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t quite know,&#8221; Stefeli replied, &#8220;perhaps
because Alida gave him music lessons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what a strange case!&#8221; Mr. Delrick remarked
with a smile. &#8220;I suppose you have
always been with your brother. You must miss
him now that you are all alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course, and mother does, too, and he
is missed also on the pasture. We were on the
pasture all day long. Father has a cow-boy now
and my mother won&#8217;t let me go to the pasture any
more. Father said the cows won&#8217;t graze and are
running about as if lost. Schwärzeli wants
to jump all the hedges, and when the new boy
chases her she turns about wildly and runs away
frightened. I believe it, too. We have known
each other so long and well, and she doesn&#8217;t like
a new boy who tries to rule her. She doesn&#8217;t
know his voice and she doesn&#8217;t feel at home at all,
poor Schwärzeli!&#8221;</p>

<p>When Stefeli had gotten as far as that in her
recital the door opened and her mother entered.
Mr. Delrick, going to meet her, said that he had
come with her husband&#8217;s permission to ask her
a question, but as he had heard of her recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
sorrow from her little daughter, he did not feel it
right to trouble her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is often good for us if we have to pull
ourselves together. Then we have less time
to brood over our troubles,&#8221; Mrs. Lesa replied
collectedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be still better to look on our grief
as if it were no grief at all. That makes it yet
easier to bear. What do you think, Mrs.
Lesa?&#8221; said Mr. Delrick as confidentially as an
old friend.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I understand what the gentleman
means, but I hardly seem to find an answer,&#8221; she
replied after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no hurry,&#8221; said Mr. Delrick kindly.
&#8220;If you will permit me to live in your home for a
few months we might find many an hour to continue
our conversation.&#8221;</p>

<p>More astonished than ever, Mrs. Lesa glanced
at the stranger. A happy smile spread for a
moment over her features, only to disappear as
suddenly. &#8220;It does not depend on me alone,
sir,&#8221; she said calmly. &#8220;I know that my husband
won&#8217;t have strangers in the house. That settles
the matter, I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>&#8220;Mr. Lesa and I understand each other
already,&#8221; said Mr. Delrick. &#8220;He told me himself
that he would be satisfied with whatever you
decide to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa knew not what to think. Only a
short time ago her husband had positively declared
that he wanted no strangers to live with
him. However, the gentleman might look at
the two rooms possible, in order to know if they
would suit him. She would then consult with
her husband and send him word at the hotel.
Having no intention to hurry Mrs. Lesa in her
decision, Mr. Delrick agreed. Climbing the
stairs, he glanced into the rooms. One had an
eastern exposure and in the other the noonday
sun was shining through the windows. The
branches of the old walnut trees outside were
swaying in the breeze, and Mr. Delrick was immensely
taken with them. If he had had his way
he would have taken possession of the rooms at
once. This Mrs. Lesa could not fail to observe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must say good-bye to your little
daughter,&#8221; he said going towards the door. &#8220;We
are good friends already and I hope we can continue
to be so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stefeli, who had been hiding behind her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
mother, shot forward at these words. She had
taken in everything and had followed her mother
in order to find out if the gentleman liked
the rooms. She was hoping that he would come
to live there. That would give her somebody to
talk to, for he had listened very attentively to
everything she had told him about the pasture.</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick, shaking her hand, begged her to
lead him up to the pasture some day. At parting
Mrs. Lesa promised to send their decision to him
as soon as possible, for he was anxious to know.</p>

<p>When Vinzenz Lesa returned home in the
evening, the first question he asked his wife was,
&#8220;Well, what did you settle with the gentleman?&#8221;</p>

<p>She told him about their conversation and her
having put off a decided answer until she knew
what he thought about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am quite sure, Vinzenz,&#8221; she concluded,
&#8220;if this gentleman comes to live with us
he is sure to bring a blessing to our home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose we need not scorn it,&#8221; replied the
farmer. &#8220;You had better send him word that
we expect him soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>His wife did so with joy in her heart and a
few days ago later Mr. Delrick moved into Mr.
Lesa&#8217;s house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>BANISHMENT</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">DURING the first half of the journey
Vinzi had not spoken. The thought
that he was to spend a long time in
the midst of strangers far from his home lay
heavily upon him. He hardly realized what
went on about him. In Berisal his companion
took him to the inn belonging to his father&#8217;s
friend. When the latter had questioned the
boy sufficiently about the trip, he found it wise
for Vinzi to have supper and immediately go
to bed, as he was sure to be tired from the long
waken till his fellow-traveller firmly shook him the
next morning. As the sun was already high, it was
necessary to hurry; but that did not trouble
Vinzi, for he was used to that at home. On the
days when they had gone to the pasture Stefeli
was nearly always dressed when he got up, and
he had had to be quick to get ready in time. Oh,
if only Stefeli were there now to call him, and
if only his mother would come in to say a few
friendly words! Vinzi had to fight hard to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
back the tears. He was dressed in a short time
and sat down to his cup of coffee in the room
where his companion awaited him. The two
companions went silently up the mountain. Poor
Vinzi felt stranger and stranger as he neared
his destination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, boy,&#8221; said the young workman, who
had been whistling all the time, &#8220;do you see that
stone house?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi saw it and in his terror he could not utter
a syllable. He thought that the gloomy gray
house on the stony slope was his cousin&#8217;s place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I see it,&#8221; he finally said in a very
low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stop there to get something to eat,&#8221;
said the young man. &#8220;After that comes the
last stretch we have to climb. From then on it
goes down hill and you&#8217;ll soon be there. I have to
go all the way down to the next valley, so we won&#8217;t
have much time to rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi was perfectly indifferent. He felt little
enough inclination to eat and was constantly
picturing to himself his arrival at the house of
his unknown cousins. Maybe it looked as gloomy
as the gray house of stone. His inner agitation
constantly increased while they had a short lunch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and afterwards when they silently took to the
road again. They stood on the summit now and
the path began to slope down hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; asked Vinzi glancing
timidly at a large building which lay at the left of
the road. Despite the fact that it seemed to
shelter many people, everything about it lay
in soundless peace and not a human being could
be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing bad, you don&#8217;t need to be
frightened,&#8221; said the young fellow. &#8220;On the
contrary, it is a nice place. Good monks live
there, who take in people that travel by in winter,
half frozen. They have a warm fire for you and
a drop of something warm to strengthen you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that over there?&#8221; asked Vinzi
again after a little while, when an old solitary
tower showed itself to the right of the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you have to live there? Don&#8217;t
make such eyes!&#8221; said the young man. &#8220;I
shouldn&#8217;t like to live there myself. It is as quiet
here as if it were at the end of the world. But
they do grow old here. Ten years ago I saw
a man sitting there with his hair and beard as
white as the snow on that peak. A year ago I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
saw him, too, and sure enough, there he is again.
Quick now, boy, you don&#8217;t have far to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the end was not reached before half an
hour&#8217;s vigorous tramp was behind them. Pointing
down hill the workman said, &#8220;Look at that
white building down there! That&#8217;s a little chapel.
A few houses are about it and they call the hamlet
&#8216;Bychapel.&#8217; The village is a bit further down,
but your uncle lives near the chapel. I&#8217;ll show
you the house and then I&#8217;ll leave you. You
can&#8217;t possibly miss your way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi stared breathlessly ahead of him, and
without once looking back, rushed forward.
They had reached the chapel, which was a little
way from the road on a hillock. The young
man stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here we are!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Pass the
chapel to your right and go to the very last house
which has a barn beside it. Lorenz Lesa lives
there. Good-bye now and good luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, thank you!&#8221; said Vinzi, as he
sadly shook hands.</p>

<p>The young man turned about and went
whistling on his way and Vinzi looked after
him. The last person who was connected with
his home had vanished and nothing but the unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
lay before him. But alas! it had to be.
He did as he was told and found the house on the
grassy slope.</p>

<p>A small, stone building behind it was evidently
the stable. At the other side was a brown
construction covered with stones and shingles,
evidently the barn, where the supply of hay was
kept. As the small door of the barn was wide
open and everything about the house was still
and the house door shut, Vinzi went towards it.
He knew well enough that one couldn&#8217;t get into
the door from the ground except by clambering
up the boards, for the hut was raised off the
ground by four posts to keep the hay dry and
airy. Vinzi climbed in through the extremely
low door, where a grown up person was obliged to
stoop. A tall, strongly-built man was straightening
up the hay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening!&#8221; Vinzi called out. &#8220;Does
this barn belong to Lorenz Lesa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does, what do you want with him?&#8221; the
man called back.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is our cousin. I belong to Vinzenz Lesa
in Leuk and father sends you his good greetings.
He said you knew about my coming
here,&#8221; Vinzi went on confidentially, for he hoped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
that this man who had already won his trust
might be his uncle.</p>

<p>Sticking his fork into the hay, the man came
nearer in order to hear better.</p>

<p>He looked the boy straight in the eye, offered
him his hand, and said pleasantly, &#8220;Oh, I see!
Are you really Vinzi? I am glad you have come
to your relatives. Did you come up here
all alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi&#8217;s heart had opened at the glance of the
friendly eyes and the kindly sound of his voice.
He bravely raised his eyes from the floor at which
he had been staring till now, and told about his
travels. He was so glad, he said, to have found
his uncle so soon, for he had been quite frightened
at the thought of coming among strangers.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to be afraid of,&#8221; said the
uncle good-humoredly. &#8220;My boys are not exactly
tame, but you can manage with them. You
must be hungry and thirsty now,&#8221; he went on,
&#8220;and we had better go over to your aunt, who&#8217;ll
look after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi was on the ground with a jump and his
uncle followed. Just at that moment a woman
of rather generous proportions opened the door
and calmly looked about her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>&#8220;I have to let the smoke out a bit,&#8221; she remarked
to her husband. Then observing the boy
at her husband&#8217;s side, she calmly looked him over.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am bringing you our nephew from Leuk,&#8221;
said the man, &#8220;but he is still a bit afraid of us.
Please look out that he doesn&#8217;t feel worse.&#8221; At
this last remark the man slightly chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I frighten no children,&#8221; answered the
woman deliberately, giving Vinzi her hand.
&#8220;Welcome to our house, nephew.&#8221; Then she
began to inspect him so thoroughly from top to
toe that her husband finally said, &#8220;I should think
it better if you examined the rest of him inside.
Can&#8217;t you see that the boy still has the pack on his
back? I am sure he wouldn&#8217;t take it amiss to
have something to eat after the long tramp he
has had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can have something right away,&#8221; said
the woman. &#8220;Supper is nearly ready, but the
smoke drove me from the stove. I&#8217;ll put the
food on the table and we can begin to eat. We
don&#8217;t need to wait for the boys; they are sure to
turn up sooner or later.&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning towards the house, she freed Vinzi
of his pack. Not very long afterwards he sat
comfortably at the table with his aunt and uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and as soon as all fear of the strange relatives
had left him he was suddenly conscious of the
most tremendous appetite. Despite the long trip
he had barely eaten. The cousin seemed somehow
to have guessed this, for long before the
boy&#8217;s plate was empty he heaped it full again
with steaming potatoes and lovely yellow cheese.
This combination tasted so delicious together that
Vinzi thought he had never eaten anything better
in his life.</p>

<p>Once in a while his aunt would say, &#8220;Give him
more milk. You mustn&#8217;t forget how parched he
must be from the wind and dust of his long trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi needed no urging to drink one cup of
fresh milk after another. All of a sudden shrill
voices and calls could be heard outside, followed
by the loud flicking of whips and happy cries.
Vinzi looked out of the window, amazed, but
saw nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are the boys! They have come home
with the cows. I must quickly run out to help
them, for they can&#8217;t attend to the cattle alone.
I suppose you&#8217;ve never done so either? Would
you like to come out and see our cows and
the stable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, leave him alone now!&#8221; said the aunt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
&#8220;Why should he rush about after all the walking
he&#8217;s done? He can start the day with the boys
tomorrow, if he wants to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only asked, because boys usually like to be
where something lively is going on,&#8221; replied
Lorenz Lesa, &#8220;but he shall be free to say what
he prefers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to stay here,&#8221; replied Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then,&#8221; said the uncle, as he went
outside.</p>

<p>The aunt showed herself pleased that Vinzi
was willing to remain quiet and did not immediately
want to run away. First of all he was
to have another cup of milk to lay the last bit of
dust from the journey. Then folding her arms
and settling comfortably into her chair she said:
&#8220;Now tell me about your people at home and the
kind of life you lead there. I like to hear about
such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi was pleased at this opportunity to talk
about his home. He had been wondering all
the time what his mother was doing just then,
whether Stefeli was alone on the pasture, and
how everything was getting along without him.
He told his aunt about their household, especially
how his mother and Stefeli usually spent the day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>A loud tramping neared the door now and the
next instant it was flung open. A boy of Vinzi&#8217;s
age came running in, followed by a little chap
and one much larger, who apparently resented
being the last. Quickly giving a high jump, he
tried to leap over the little one&#8217;s head by propping
himself on his shoulders. But quick as a
wink the sly little one ducked down and the big
boy fell headlong with a thump.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not enter in such an unmannerly
fashion, Faz,&#8221; said the mother calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, cousin,&#8221; said the eldest, holding
his hand out to Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, cousin,&#8221; cried the second boy,
too, and &#8220;Good evening cousin,&#8221; also called the
youngest, pushing his way very near to Vinzi.</p>

<p>Vinzi heartily shook the proffered hands and
answered their salutations. Meanwhile the father
had come in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must know each other&#8217;s names, boys,&#8221;
he said, stepping towards the group. &#8220;Your
cousin&#8217;s is Vinzi, which is short for Vinzenz. My
three are called Joseph, Bonifaz and Maurus.
But these are their calendar names, and we call
them Jos, Faz and Russli. I think you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
better sit down now, for the potatoes have cooled
off enough to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am glad,&#8221; said the mother with satisfaction,
&#8220;then they won&#8217;t burn their throats
today. Usually they do when they are in such
a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>All three settled down to the important business
of eating. They said nothing, but their
glances resting on Vinzi showed that he occupied
their thoughts completely.</p>

<p>Now that the tumult had subsided and one
could speak and hear without exertion, the
mother said, &#8220;As our relatives did not let us know
beforehand that Vinzi was coming, we did not get
ready for him. But I have an idea. If he is to
sleep in the house we shall have to clear out the
store-room where wheat, corn and all kinds of
things are kept. The mice up there squeak and
scratch so much that they might frighten him.
Wouldn&#8217;t it be much better if we fixed him a bed
in the hay-rick? He would really be much more
comfortable there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have to say himself where he&#8217;d rather
sleep,&#8221; put in the uncle. &#8220;If he prefers the store-room,
we&#8217;ll all of us go up and clear everything
away. Vinzi, where would you rather sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to sleep in the hay-rick,&#8221; replied
Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; said his aunt, quite relieved
that the matter was so quickly settled. &#8220;And you
must have a little table, a bench and a chest of
drawers to make you comfortable,&#8221; she added.
&#8220;As soon as you are all done with supper you can
take some things over for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went out first in search of what was
needed, and soon after the three boys had finished
their meal and hastened after her. When Vinzi
rose in order to make himself useful, too, the
uncle assured him that the heavy pack he had
carried on his back was enough work for that day.
Hanging it on his arm, the man beckoned to
Vinzi to follow him. They had scarcely reached
the hay-rick, when the three boys came running
along. Jos carried a little cupboard, Faz had a
small table with a large blanket on top, and Russli
brought a little bench. The mother with the
pillow and sheets followed behind. With an
agility clearly showing how used she was to climbing
into the barn, the aunt had gone in. One
thing after another was lifted up by Lorenz Lesa,
and she pulled them in through the door.</p>

<p>When the last one was inside, the uncle said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
&#8220;We&#8217;ll say good-night to you now. On the inside
of the door is a wooden bolt that you can
fasten. Once inside, you are the sole master of
your castle and no person can come whom you
wish to keep out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the aunt came down again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is ready for you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And
look, nephew, over there is the stream, where you
can wash yourself. No one will disturb you there.
I laid a towel for you on the bench. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cousins all wished him good-night, too,
but Jos turned round once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you coming up to the pasture with us
tomorrow morning, Vinzi? Do you expect to stay
with us all day while we mind the cows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly,&#8221; replied Vinzi. &#8220;I&#8217;ll help
you all I can, but you must tell me which I have
to mind most. Please call me in the morning, so
that I shan&#8217;t be late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I&#8217;ll call to you loudly through the
round air-hole,&#8221; Jos promised. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be able
to hear me well enough.&#8221; With that he ran away.</p>

<p>Vinzi was left alone. Climbing up through
the door, he inspected his barn. In a corner on
a high, soft pile of hay his bed was spread. Beside
it the hay had been pushed away to give room for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the table and the bench, and at the wall stood his
little cupboard. It all looked like a cosy and inviting
little room. But he was not able to sleep
because the unusual happenings of the day had
excited him so much. Sitting down on the board
which formed his threshold, he looked outside.
The stars were glowing above him in the heavens
and just then the moon rose from behind the
mountains. It was beginning to light up the
dark trees and meadows and the little church
looked very white, and the high snow-peak rising
above the rocky ranges became more and more
brilliant every minute. Vinzi opened his eyes
very wide, for in his great terror of what lay
before him he had seen practically nothing after
the gloomy house on the mountain desert.
He had made up his mind that only frightful
things would happen to him. How different
was the scene now before him from what he
had anticipated!</p>

<p>There was no stony desert here. On the contrary,
the moonlight gleamed peacefully down
to the green slope and sparkled on the tops of the
larch trees over the way. In the peaceful silence
he could hear the continuous soft gurgling of the
near-by stream. Vinzi listened to the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
while the tones grew fuller and louder till lovely
melodies could be distinguished. He must have
been sitting there for a considerable time when
a strong gust of wind suddenly pushed the door to
against his knee and woke him from his dreaming.
He had never in his life seen the stars above him
sparkle as they did that night. His mother&#8217;s
words that the good God in Heaven was above
him everywhere and could hear and watch him
now suddenly occurred to him. Many times he
had heard her say these words, but at that moment
his heart fully realized them. It gave him
a sense that Heaven was very near him and filled
his soul with gratitude to God who had let him
find happiness where he had anticipated evil.
How groundless had been his fear of his uncle and
aunt! They had received and treated him so
kindly that he already felt at home. In his joy
he would have loved to fill the night with a loud
song of praise, but it was too late for that. Not
a single light could be seen about him; everyone
in all the cottages, far and near, was apparently
fast asleep.</p>

<p>After shutting and bolting the door, he sought
his fragrant bed, which was soft and splendid,
for no hay could prick him through the heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
sheets. Opposite his bed an especially bright star
kept gleaming in through the round hole in the
wall. He tried to shut his eyes, but it shone so
brightly that he could not help gazing at it.
Even when his lids seemed to be closing he opened
them again to see it. Yes, the star was still shining.
What was more, Vinzi could distinguish
some faint, beautiful music, which finally put him
to sleep. The star was singing to Vinzi so that
he could hear it even in his dreams.</p>

<p>Next morning Vinzi was awakened by a
dreadful noise, caused by his name being screamed
by many voices at once. Stefeli had never called
as loudly as that to waken him, thought Vinzi,
still half asleep. But all of a sudden he realized
where he was and whose loud voices had apparently
been shouting for a long time in vain.
Rapidly putting on the most necessary clothing,
he opened his door wide and leaped down among
his noisy cousins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up, come along!&#8221; they called all at
once and Jos added, &#8220;Take your jacket along.
As soon as we&#8217;ve had breakfast, we are off.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Vinzi was not even washed yet, he begged
them not to wait for him as he would rather follow
them later.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>The two older ones quickly ran off, but Russli
going with Vinzi to the stream, said confidentially,
&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to wash yourself. You
don&#8217;t look dirty: come with us, Vinzi, you are
clean enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Russli,&#8221; Vinzi answered. &#8220;One
must wash every morning and besides it makes
one feel better. Oh, what nice, clear water.&#8221; So
saying Vinzi kneeled down and taking up handfuls
he poured the fresh water over his face
again and again, and also drank one handful
after another.</p>

<p>This made a deep impression on Russli, for
Vinzi looked refreshed and radiant. Meditating
deeply the little boy said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll come and wash
myself here with you and I&#8217;ll drink afterwards
like you, too. I&#8217;ll do it every day from now on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having finished his toilet, Vinzi fetched his
jacket and went over to the house with Russli.</p>

<p>Both uncle and aunt, who were still at breakfast,
greeted Vinzi kindly. The aunt set a large
cup of coffee before him and entreated the boy
to help himself to lots of bread, as the strong
mountain air would soon give him a fresh appetite.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to have let you sleep longer after
your trip,&#8221; said the uncle, &#8220;but the boys were just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
wild for you to go with them. They are so
pleased to have a cousin who belongs to
them now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just take your time,&#8221; urged the aunt when
she saw that Vinzi was hurrying in order to finish
his breakfast. &#8220;Your uncle will go out with you
when you are done, and he has not finished either.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the uncle rose soon after, Vinzi followed
him.</p>

<p>Jos and Faz had been flicking their whips for
quite a while to show that they were ready. The
father unfastened one cow after another from her
stall and the whole procession began to move.
Quite a stretch of road beyond the chapel had to
be passed before the pasture-ground for the day
could be reached. Russli had immediately come
to Vinzi&#8217;s side and was firmly grasping his hand.
He tried to hold Vinzi back as much as possible,
while Faz and Jos were busy driving the cows
along. This was difficult, because the luscious
grass along the sides constantly tempted them to
stray from the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me alone, Russli,&#8221; Vinzi said hurrying
forward. &#8220;You see I must help your brothers
to keep the cows in order.&#8221;</p>

<p>During a struggle Faz had with a cow who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
was trying to clean off a tender bush by the roadside
he heard these words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep Russli out of mischief for us,&#8221; he
called back to Vinzi. &#8220;You can&#8217;t possibly help
us better than that. The little chap always
tickles the cows with his rod and that makes them
run from side to side. If they do that we can
barely manage them. Russli is a mischievous
little fellow, you&#8217;d better hold him tight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Faz at last got control of his obstinate cow
and, driving her along, followed the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vinzi,&#8221; asked Russli, overjoyed at being
able to have his new cousin&#8217;s company, &#8220;have you
a knife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course, everybody needs one,&#8221; Vinzi
replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on and I&#8217;ll show you a fine bush,&#8221;
said Russli, &#8220;where the branches are thick below
and very thin above; you know they are very
strong, too. Won&#8217;t you cut me a few good willow
sticks. Mine is broken and I can&#8217;t do it myself
because I am not allowed to have a knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you want the stick?&#8221; asked Vinzi.
&#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t want it for beating the cows.
You heard what Faz just told me about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t beat them, but I like to tickle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
them a bit,&#8221; explained Russli. &#8220;That makes
them jump and they get lively.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Russli, they don&#8217;t think it fun,&#8221;
said Vinzi. &#8220;They jump from fright, because
such thin whips hurt them very much. I won&#8217;t
make you any sticks for that. But show me the
bush, and if the wood is good I&#8217;ll cut you something
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course Russli was terribly curious to know
what Vinzi meant to make him. But Vinzi
declared he would not tell till he had seen the
bush and asked Jos a question. Expectantly
Russli ran ahead. Soon they turned off from
the road to a grove, where they found a large bush
whose branches stood up perfectly straight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Russli, pulling Vinzi along.</p>

<p>Vinzi, gazing with satisfaction at the firm
branches, began to cut those which pleased
him most.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now,&#8221; he said after having gathered a
considerable bunch, &#8220;we must go to your
brothers. Do you know where they are? I can&#8217;t
see them any more. I&#8217;ll cut it for you when I
get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Russli hastened on followed by Vinzi.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, how lovely it is here,&#8221; Vinzi exclaimed
and stood still. &#8220;But where is the pasture?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Russli.</p>

<p>Vinzi looked about him. Here and there
isolated high, dark larches let in the deep-blue sky
through their delicate branches. On the lovely
green slope little patches of fiery red alpine-roses
glowed between moss-covered stones. The full
mountain stream was rushing down hill throwing
up snow-white foam whenever rocks tried to bar
its course. Vinzi could see the cows quietly grazing
a short distance away. He stood without
moving. Never in his life had he seen such a
pasture. The slanting sun fell through the trees
on the glowing flowers and sparkled on the waving
grass. The soft mountain air, gently fanning
the trees, played with the shadows and soughed
through their branches with a delicate song.</p>

<p>The soughing seemed first to grow, then to
die away in the far distance. Vinzi had not moved
from the spot, gazing and listening intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;When will you cut me what you promised?&#8221;
asked Russli quite angrily, for his patience had
given out with waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll come,&#8221; said Vinzi, as if
awakening from a dream. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come. But it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
is wonderful here! Hold these sticks a minute,
Russli. I&#8217;ll come right back and make you what
I said I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi ran over to the grazing place and looked
about for his cousins. Across the road was a
very large pasture without trees and with many
cattle. Vinzi could see a small group of goat-herds
bending over a smoking spot on the ground.
They were apparently trying to make a fire, but
as it would not burn, were shouting all at once
and causing much confusion. Vinzi saw Jos and
Faz among them. First he called to Jos a considerable
time in vain, but when Jos finally heard
him, he came over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to us, Vinzi!&#8221; he called out, running.
&#8220;We are making a fire, or I should rather call
it smoke. One of the boys found a hole, and we
think some kind of animal, maybe a marmot, is
inside. It&#8217;ll come out if the smoke gets into the
hole. Then we can catch it. Come, we&#8217;ll have
such fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;d rather not,&#8221; said Vinzi, for he had
not the slightest desire to see a little frightened
beast jump out of the hole, and much less to see
all the boys chase it and frighten it more. &#8220;I
promised Russli to come back. But I must ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
you something. Do you think your father would
mind if I cut Russli a pipe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should he mind? What do you mean?
I couldn&#8217;t even guess why not?&#8221; Jos exclaimed.
&#8220;I am sure he couldn&#8217;t possibly object, and we
are only too glad if you keep Russli busy. He
makes the cows simply wild and that keeps us
chasing them. The minute they see him even
they begin to run.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t I help you mind the cows?&#8221;
asked Vinzi, slightly concerned. &#8220;Can I really
sit down quietly and cut out pipes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t help us any better way than that,&#8221;
said Jos. &#8220;Please believe me. Look how peacefully
they are grazing. If Russli were teasing
them, they would long ago have begun to
run around.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi was delighted at being told his share of
the day&#8217;s work and he went back to Russli.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Russli,&#8221; said Vinzi on reaching the
little boy, &#8220;watch what I shall make.&#8221;</p>



<p>As he settled down on a moss covered rock,
the reddish-purple violets beside him exhaled
such a sweet perfume that he had to draw in a
few deep breaths. Then carefully choosing one
of the branches he cut it off where it began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
grow more slender and started carving the
thicker piece.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_120fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;WHAT WILL IT BE WHEN IT&#8217;S FINISHED?&#8221; ASKED RUSSLI</p>

<p>&#8220;What will it be when it&#8217;s finished?&#8221; asked
Russli, who had settled on the stone by Vinzi&#8217;s
side and was eagerly following the work.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be a pipe to play music on,&#8221; was the
answer.</p>

<p>Russli moved nearer to the carver in delighted
surprise, for he was afraid he would lose
something of the creation of this wonderful thing.
Russli knew the little hollow pipes that usually
broke right away, but he had never seen such a
thick, long wooden pipe as his cousin was making.
Vinzi had learned and invented many things since
he had cut his first pipes that could only give
forth one tone. He cut several holes now in
order to have several tones played on it. But it
took considerable time to bore the small round
holes, because Vinzi was very particular. Several
hours passed. Once in a while Vinzi stopped to
listen to the wind singing in the branches, and to
the merry wavelets of the mountain stream that
gave forth sometimes a song of joy and sometimes
a low plaintive note. Sometimes he stooped
down to inhale the delicious perfume of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
violets beside him. But at last he snapped shut
his knife.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, Russli! Take your pipe, it is
finished!&#8221;</p>

<p>With glistening eyes the little boy set his pipe
to his lips and produced the most penetrating
sound. Russli was quite scared at the loud noise
he had made, for he had blown into the pipe with
all his might.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better blow it,&#8221; he said, giving the
instrument to Vinzi.</p>

<p>At that instant they heard a shrill whistle
followed by a second. It was clearly a summons.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is time to eat,&#8221; said Russli. &#8220;They
always whistle that way when we are to gather
together for lunch. Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Russli was already bounding away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at my pipe! Look, I have a pipe!&#8221;
he called loudly to his brothers, who were already
eating. As soon as Russli saw this, he looked
about till he found the lunch-bag, which lay like
a lost object on the ground. Quickly pulling out
his share he gave Vinzi the food meant for him.
&#8220;Take it!&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is yours. The others
have already taken theirs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi did this and settled himself beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Russli. But he could not help thinking what
Stefeli would say to them if she saw how they
only looked after themselves, as if they had
had a fight.</p>

<p>Jos had finished in the meantime and called
from his seat to Russli, &#8220;Give me the pipe, I
want to try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and get it,&#8221; said Russli in a curt way.</p>

<p>Vinzi had already risen to bring it to Jos,
when the latter quickly jumped up, asserting that
if he wanted it, it was for him to fetch it. Faz
had joined them, too, now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show it to me,&#8221; he cried, but Jos, who was
already holding it to his lips, pushed Faz away.
Now the music began. All Jos knew was that
the fingers had to be placed on the different holes
to produce various sounds. He succeeded in that
but they had a terribly harsh, disconnected tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it to me, you don&#8217;t know how,&#8221; cried
Faz, grabbing the pipe.</p>

<p>But under his fingers the pipe shrilled and
yelled more hideously still.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks so fine,&#8221; said Jos regretfully, &#8220;and
we could never have made so nice a one, but it
does not sound nice.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>Vinzi had finished his lunch by that time and
took the pipe from Faz.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to try it, too,&#8221; he said. With this
he began to play a little song, one tone clearly
and beautifully following the other. Dumb with
amazement the three stood before him and
listened spellbound.</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly know how to play, Vinzi;
won&#8217;t you teach me, too?&#8221; asked Jos eagerly as
soon as Vinzi had paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me, too,&#8221; cried Faz.</p>

<p>&#8220;And me, too,&#8221; repeated Russli.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me the pipe,&#8221; begged Jos impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, give it to me,&#8221; cried Faz, but Russli
had already snatched it up and run away with his
property for fear that he would be robbed of it
by superior strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave it to him,&#8221; said Vinzi, &#8220;I&#8217;ll make you
each one out of the sticks I have. I can easily
get all I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>This quieted the brothers, and as they wanted
more music they called Russli. Jos especially
had been delighted with it. But no calling could
bring Russli back. Finally, Vinzi had to hasten
after him to explain that he was not to lose his
precious gift. The boys sat about in a close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
group now, for every one of them wanted to be
as near to Vinzi as possible to see how it was done.
He was made to play on and on, every conceivable
tune he had ever known. When finally his
memory gave out, he made up pieces out of songs
of birds and the sounds of bells he had heard.</p>

<p>The group of listeners had constantly grown,
for the boys from the other pastures waiting in
vain for Faz and Jos, had gone to seek them.
They got together every afternoon, usually to
perpetrate some mischief, and Jos and Faz being
mostly the leaders, they needed them. But the
music pleased all the boys so much that they remained.
The afternoon slipped away unnoticed.</p>

<p>One of the boys suddenly cried, &#8220;I hear the
horn, it must be six o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately they dispersed, but before going
they called back to Vinzi, &#8220;Bring it with you tomorrow!
Bring it tomorrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was high time for Faz and Jos to collect
their cows to drive them home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Vinzi, keep the little chap away
from us going home. We&#8217;ll get along much
faster then. That&#8217;s the best way for you to
help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi was only too glad to take charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Russli. If his cousins found him most useful
that way, he had a good conscience doing it,
though it certainly was no hard work. Russli
was also satisfied. Taking Vinzi&#8217;s hand he
strolled harmlessly by his side as if he had never
played the slightest trick in his life. But he
demanded to be entertained. Every time Vinzi
stopped talking to listen to a bird&#8217;s song or the
gurgling of the stream, the little chap reminded
him of his presence. When they approached the
house they saw the father standing under the
door to greet them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how did you get along the first day,
nephew?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;How did you like it on
our pasture?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A pipe, look at my pipe! Here, father, take
it!&mdash;it sounds fine,&#8221; Russli interrupted loudly,
holding the pipe as closely as he could to his
father&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, there they come with the cows,&#8221; said
the father. &#8220;Go in and show it to your mother.
I&#8217;ll soon come, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I loved it on the pasture,&#8221; Vinzi was now
able to answer. &#8220;It is splendid there under the
trees. The day passed so quickly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and Vinzi helped us so much,&#8221; added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Jos, who had joined them. &#8220;We got up there
about ten times quicker than usual and all day
the cows were quietly grazing, something they
have not done for ages. I wish Vinzi would stay
with us always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear that,&#8221; said the father.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a good beginning and I hope you will
keep on that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went with the boys to the stable, and
Vinzi followed, thinking that his uncle might
need his help there.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221; he called to his uncle
through the open stable door.</p>

<p>The latter was busy milking. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be
done before very long,&#8221; answered he, &#8220;but you
can look about in the barn and stable, if you
care to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi went out. The sunset glow was gilding
the rocky mountains opposite, the dark spruces
had bright, golden tops, and now the bell of the
little chapel began to fill the air with its lovely,
peaceful music. Vinzi, carried completely away
by all the beauty, stood and listened, rooted to
the spot. He stood thus until the glow had
faded and the chapel bell had stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; cried a voice behind him, while a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
brisk blow fell on his back. Then he was pulled
by force to the pump, where the very necessary
daily ablutions had to be made before supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you awake again?&#8221; asked Faz, who had
pulled Vinzi along in the firm belief that he had
fallen asleep in the middle of the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and your fists would certainly have
awakened him before he got to the water,&#8221; said
Jos, who had stepped up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; replied Vinzi, &#8220;but I would
rather he pulled me along than that he told your
father that I fell asleep in the middle of the road.
I wasn&#8217;t asleep, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t a tell-tale, but he certainly can give
a good blow,&#8221; Jos comforted Vinzi.</p>

<p>Faz proceeded to the house, followed by the
others. The mother was waiting at the table,
patiently enduring the dreadful sounds Russli
made with his pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;You pipe like a cat that is half strangled,&#8221;
Faz cried upon entering.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not make fun of him right away,&#8221;
said the mother. &#8220;He does not play so badly
for a little boy. He was just telling me something
nice about you, Faz. He said that you did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
not beat him all day, and that he never cried
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He only gets hit if he deserves it,&#8221; said Faz.
&#8220;He behaved well today because Vinzi was
amusing him. I hope Vinzi stays with us always.
Everything went as smoothly as possible today.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other three entered now and Russli immediately
flew to his father with the cry, &#8220;Now
the pipe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Russli, first we eat and then comes
the pipe,&#8221; said the father sitting down. &#8220;You
see when I was their age I also liked to cut pipes
and blow on them. I&#8217;ll have to look it over a bit,
and then try if I still know how.&#8221;</p>

<p>Russli was satisfied when he saw the deliciously
smelling hot corn-cake his mother had put
on the table. He immediately attacked his
heaped-up plate.</p>

<p>After supper, when everybody leaned back
happily in their chairs and the mother had
cleared the table, the father said, &#8220;Now let me
see the pipe; I want to hear what it sounds like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Russli, being rather sleepy after his hearty
meal, found it hard to rouse himself. But he
heard his father&#8217;s words and was dreadfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
afraid that Faz might bring his pipe to the father
first, maybe even keep it afterwards. This
brought him to his feet.</p>

<p>When he approached with it, the father exclaimed
with surprise, examining the long pipe
on all sides, &#8220;What a well-made pipe! This is
no ordinary pipe at all, but a regular shepherd&#8217;s
pipe with all the regular holes. I wonder if I
can still play.&#8221;</p>

<p>Setting it to his lips, he brought forth sounds
that somewhat resembled melody.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, father can do it better the first time,
than we did after trying lots of times,&#8221; said Jos
astonished. &#8220;Only Vinzi can do it better still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must hear him now,&#8221; said the father,
handing the pipe to the boy. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you please
play for us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi remembered one piece better than any
and he had already played it for the boys at least
ten times that day. It was the little tune Alida
had taught him.</p>

<p>He started to play.</p>

<p>When he came to the end there was no sound
for a moment, because the lovely melody had
moved everyone deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course he plays differently from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
me,&#8221; said the uncle. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to know who
taught you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it fine to have something beautiful like
that in one&#8217;s own house, without having to seek it
elsewhere?&#8221; said the aunt, quite overcome. &#8220;It&#8217;s
worth more than many great festivities. If our
musician only could play us a beautiful hymn,
we could all join in and sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to,&#8221; said Vinzi, &#8220;I know lots,
because mother always sings one at home with
us every evening. What shall I play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You probably know the same ones I do.
Can you play, &#8216;I Sing to You with Heart and
Mouth&#8217;?&#8221; asked the aunt.</p>

<p>Vinzi knew the hymn very well. After seeking
a little for the notes he began to play firmly.
The aunt sang heartily, the uncle raised a
splendid bass and suddenly Jos joined in with a
rich, fine voice. Faz growled low sometimes
after his father, then he took up his mother&#8217;s high
notes. Russli squeaked all sorts of tones too, but
the other voices were so strong that it did not
disturb the singing. The aunt was so happy
over the music that she clamored for another
song as soon as the first was done. Then another,
and still another.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>The uncle said happily, &#8220;That was a fine
entertainment, and we must do it again tomorrow.
We can&#8217;t do any better than praise
God with music.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Vinzi came to his hay-rick his heart was
so full of thanksgiving that he was obliged to sit
down a while on his high threshold. Looking up
to the sky he saw thousands of stars looking
happily down upon him. Oh, how wonderfully
beautiful it was here. The father had said that
it was a splendid thing to praise God with music.
Tomorrow they would be allowed to do it again
and probably every day after that, thought Vinzi
to himself. The pipe had pleased the uncle, too,
and he seemed to enjoy hearing it. The happiness
in Vinzi&#8217;s heart rose higher and higher at
this thought. He felt as if he had to sing out
loudly once more. In fact it seemed as if all he
had to do was to join in the great song of praise
which came to him from all sides, from the shining
stars, the gleaming chapel, the merrily rushing
stream, and the golden moon over the high
mountains. He quietly sang to the glorious,
magic music about him.</p>

<p>The wind stirred gently and wafted the perfume
from the pungent hay to Vinzi&#8217;s senses.
Suddenly he remembered where he was. As it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
had grown very cool, he quickly closed the door
and sought his inviting bed.</p>

<p>From that day on Lorenz Leza&#8217;s family had
music every night. They sang eagerly as if it
was the chief work of the day. But the work of
the day was behind them, and they could give
themselves freely to the joys of their happy evenings.
What pleased Vinzi most was that his
uncle and aunt always counted on having music
every night. At supper time the aunt always
said, &#8220;I look forward already to Vinzi&#8217;s playing.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the meal was over the uncle would
say, &#8220;I suppose we still have time for a song
or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whenever his uncle Lorenz started to sing,
more songs he had known in his youth rose in
his memory. Even if Vinzi did not know them,
all the uncle had to do was to sing them to the
boy a few times and the latter would repeat them
perfectly. The rest could follow his piping and
in that way learn all the songs. The uncle got a
tremendous satisfaction from it all. When such
a musical evening had passed the uncle shook
Vinzi&#8217;s hand three or four times. &#8220;You can
make one young again with your music,&#8221; he
would say. &#8220;You are piping the joy of youth
back into my heart, boy.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>HIGHER UP THE MOUNTAIN</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ABOUT three weeks after Vinzi had come
to his uncle&#8217;s house a good friend of his
father, who had business in Domo, came
to see him. He brought him and the Lesa family
greetings from Vinzi&#8217;s parents. On his way home
he expected to stop as he had promised to bring
Vinzenz Lesa news of the boy. His parents
wanted to hear how he took to the life on the
mountain and how he got along with his relatives.
They also wondered if he annoyed his relatives by
his silent dreamy ways. The uncle and aunt were
to decide when the boy was to come home. As
soon as they were ready to let him go, they could
entrust him to some companion or send word to
Leuk where they could find one. The man was
to return in five or six days, of which the fifth
day had just passed by.</p>

<p>Lorenz entered the room. His wife had set
the supper table and was quietly awaiting the return
of the boys, when she could place their
welcome meal before them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>&#8220;The man from Leuk won&#8217;t come today,&#8221;
said Lorenz. &#8220;I suppose he&#8217;ll be here tomorrow
early. We must let them know down there how
much we like Vinzi.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed we will,&#8221; agreed the wife. &#8220;I was
just wondering to myself why they sent him here.
I would keep such a lad at home. One usually
sends a boy away when he isn&#8217;t quite as he
ought to be, or if he has queer ideas in his head
that he might lose among strangers. But there
are very few boys like Vinzi. Since he has come
here I hardly recognize our own. Take Russli,
for instance. Every morning he had to be
dragged by violence to the fountain, and while he
got washed, he usually shrieked like mad. Now
he runs over to the stream behind the hay-rick as
soon as he is out of bed. He loves to wash himself
there, he says, because Vinzi does it, too, and
likes it. Russli rubs and scrubs himself cleaner
than he would ever have let me do. He wants to
look like Vinzi, whom every one likes to look at.
Russli never comes home in tears the way he used
to, either. One might have supposed that they
had nearly killed him the way he carried on.
When I ask him what has made the change in
him, he answers that Faz is not allowed to beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
him, because Vinzi takes his part. If I ask Faz
how it is that he leaves Russli in peace he answers
that Vinzi keeps him in order and he needs no
beating. &#8216;I like it better that way,&#8217; he says
sensibly. &#8216;I wish Vinzi would stay with us
always.&#8217; Faz would never have said such a
thing before, for he used to enjoy giving
blows. Jos was the only one who never gave us
much trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose the eldest sons are always
considered models by their mothers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, Jos can show himself anywhere,&#8221;
the woman continued. &#8220;I never saw a better-mannered
boy than Vinzi, though. Jos has
noticed that and has begun to imitate him, which
suits him very well. He would only need a hat
on his head and the kind of cloak around his
shoulders that strangers on the stage-coach wear,
to look like a gentleman&#8217;s son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not necessary,&#8221; interrupted the
husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we never should have found out that
Jos has such a beautiful voice if Vinzi had not
started him with his music,&#8221; continued the wife.
&#8220;And just think of our peaceful evenings with
the lovely singing every day. We are not disturbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
any more by one boy throwing the other
under the table, while the third one is breaking
his chair by riding on it. I think that the music
has somehow tamed them. They are hardly the
same boys! I just want to say one more thing.
Why did your cousin Vinzenz send the boy up
here instead of keeping him at home? I am sure
his wife did not wish him to go&mdash;I guess that
much. Tell me, what do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can be sure that Vinzenz had a good
reason,&#8221; replied the husband. &#8220;I have asked
myself the same question and have not been able
to answer it. I remember his mentioning something
to me about the boy. When the man from
Leuk asked us if Vinzi did not annoy us with his
long fits of silence, I recollect that he thought
our boys were more merry at their work. As he
wished his boy to be the same he thought the
totally different surroundings here might help
him. He was in the right, too. Vinzi is as gay
as a lark, nowadays, and makes the others gayer
than they ever were.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cheerful cries of the home-coming boys
could now be heard. In order to assist them the
father went outside while the mother turned
towards the kitchen. The time had come to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
everything on the table in order to avoid impatience
on their part and burnt throats.</p>

<p>The next day the man from Leuk returned.
After putting a glass of wine before him Lorenz
Lesa sat down at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I tell them?&#8221; asked the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell my cousin Vinzenz that everything here
is going well,&#8221; began Lorenz, &#8220;and that his boy
is very happy. He sings and whistles like a
bird in seed time, and we with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that we love him as if he were one of
us,&#8221; added the wife. &#8220;We want to keep him
here till the very last day of autumn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and tell my cousin,&#8221; the uncle continued,
&#8220;that we should like to keep him for the
winter if he has no objection. He has not annoyed
a soul up here, on the contrary he has made
every one happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vinzenz Lesa will be glad to hear that. I&#8217;ll
carefully give him your message,&#8221; said the man.
&#8220;Mrs. Lesa also wants to know how the boy is
looking. She wants me to tell her exactly, but
I suppose he is not to be seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, for the boys are all on the pasture from
six in the morning till six at night. They sing
and whistle and could not have a better time,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
said Lorenz. &#8220;My cousin will approve of that,
I am sure, for he would certainly not like him to
stay at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And tell Mrs. Lesa that she need not
worry,&#8221; the woman went on. &#8220;Her boy looks as
well and sprightly as a cricket. If he should be
ill I&#8217;ll see to him as if he were my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s splendid,&#8221; said the messenger
from Leuk. He was satisfied with the news he
could bring to Mrs. Lesa, for she had pressed him
to inquire into the smallest details, many of which
he had quite forgotten.</p>

<p>Vinzi had kept his promise in carving Faz and
Jos each a beautiful pipe, and both were hard at
work practicing. Pipe-playing had grown to be
their sole amusement, for it was their dearest
wish to imitate Vinzi as much as possible.</p>

<p>Both realized that Vinzi&#8217;s playing was vastly
superior to theirs, but they did not give up and
tried to learn whatever they could. As soon as
they reached the pasture in the morning, the
piping began, and while the cows were grazing
peacefully they would devote themselves to
music. Jos and Faz were usually leaders of the
other boys in their sports. When these did not
appear they were very much missed by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
comrades. So the other boys came over to them,
and soon this enthusiasm about music proved
catching. Each boy wanted to try his talent for
piping and thought he could imitate Vinzi&#8217;s playing
better than any other. But they all agreed
in pronouncing him their master, for each pipe
took on a different quality when Vinzi blew it.</p>

<p>After the pipes had continuously been whining,
howling and squeaking the boys always
begged Vinzi to play. They wanted to see how
he did it, and Vinzi was only too glad to do so.
He played as long as they liked to hear him,
while they actually crowded around him and
eagerly watched his fingers. The melodies
seemed to come somehow of themselves. All he
did was to let his fingers leap lightly over the
holes, and it looked childishly simple. After
watching him each thought that he could now do
it, too, and it made every boy eager to try afresh.
If one seemingly succeeded fairly well, another
boy would say that he could do it as well if only he
had his own pipe and took time to practice. This
was impossible now, because one could not keep
the precious instrument more than a few minutes
at a time. There were already ten more who
clamored for it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>Therefore one boy after another would come
to Vinzi saying, &#8220;I wish you would cut me a nice
pipe, Vinzi; I&#8217;ll give you something for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi answered always most obligingly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
make you a pipe and you needn&#8217;t give me anything.
But you&#8217;ll have to wait for it, because I
have promised to make others first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi was kept very busy, because every day
brought him new requests for pipes. Some of
his time was taken up by playing, and Russli did
not give up his demands upon him, either. But
Vinzi felt happy and satisfied. Whatever he
could do he did gladly, and it gave him great
satisfaction to be able to spread such joy
about him.</p>

<p>The uncle was delighted to hear about the
daily gatherings on his pasture. He liked this
pursuit of music and it pleased him that boys who
lived as far up as the hospice should come down
to learn the art of piping. By cutting several
pipes every day Vinzi finally supplied nearly
every pasture ground with two or three. But
this did not suffice. As soon as a boy had succeeded
in giving forth a few satisfactory sounds
another immediately wanted to try his talent,
too. It took considerable practice and patience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
before they could attempt to play a tune, for it
was even hard to make smooth, pleasant sounds.</p>

<p>The supreme wish of each boy had become to
own a pipe which Vinzi had carved himself, for
no one else could do it so well.</p>

<p>Among the boys who met daily there were
about ten or twelve who were called the Tower
Boys. Vinzi never knew exactly how many of
them there were, because only some of them could
come down to the Lesa pasture at a time, the
others staying behind to mind the cows. Vinzi
had first believed them all to be brothers. But he
found out that they were cousins and came from
three different households. He had given two
of them pipes already, for they had been very
eager for them. One of them who was called
Black Vereli, on account of his black, curly hair
and dark complexion, had teased and begged
him for a pipe so insistently that Vinzi could not
resist his pleading. He gave him one which was
already finished despite the fact that the other
boys cried jealously, &#8220;The Tower Boys have
two already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Full of gratitude and enthusiasm, Vereli ran
away with his precious gift.</p>

<p>The next day he appeared again and quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
ran to Vinzi. &#8220;I have to mind the cows today,
but the others can stay,&#8221; he said breathlessly.
&#8220;But I have a message for you. I showed
grandfather the pipe and he made me play on it.
When he said I didn&#8217;t know how to play, I told
him that you could do it better than anybody else.
So he wants you to come and play for him sometimes.
Won&#8217;t you come some day when I have
to stay up there? Please come tomorrow, if you
can,&#8221; Vereli called back as he ran away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must ask uncle first. Where shall I go if
he lets me?&#8221; Vinzi called after the boy.</p>

<p>But he got no answer from Vereli, who was
already far away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go up to the Tower Boys,&#8221; replied
Russli. He was as usual close to Vinzi&#8217;s side
and so had heard his question.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know where they live,&#8221; replied
Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the tower, of course,&#8221; said Russli.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the reason why you call them the
Tower Boys?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Russli calmly informed him.</p>

<p>The old gray tower that had filled him with
such grave misgivings rose before Vinzi&#8217;s eyes
now. In his wild state of fear it had seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
him no less than a prison in which his uncle might
be living and where he might be obliged to live,
too. But besides the tower he had a vague recollection
of a bright meadow with shining flowers
surrounding the building. His glance had hardly
rested on these things in his foolish terror. Now
he felt suddenly seized by an intense desire to
wander up along the highway to see how all
the things looked that had grown so dim in
his recollection.</p>

<p>That evening he repeated Vereli&#8217;s words to
his uncle, asking at the same time what he was
to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go up to the tower tomorrow, boy,&#8221;
answered the uncle. The grandfather was the
oldest man on the whole mountain-side and one
had to do his bidding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose grandfather is he?&#8221; asked Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the grandfather of all the so-called
Tower Boys,&#8221; replied the uncle, &#8220;and of a huge
family besides who stay at home. Only the boys
who attend to the cattle go up there. He is in
fact their great, or even great-great grandfather.
But as that is much too complicated to say all
his relatives on the mountain call him grandfather.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
He has an enormous number of grand
and great-grandchildren.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Black Vereli is decidedly the worst of
the whole bunch,&#8221; added Faz.</p>

<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221; asked the father, who saw not
the slightest connection between his own statement
and the words which had followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I mean that the Tower Boys always
start the worst mischief and Black Vereli invents
most of their tricks,&#8221; Faz explained. &#8220;Jos
always takes his part because he can jodel
so well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes he can do it like no one else and I love
to hear him,&#8221; affirmed Jos. &#8220;I think that the
invention of naughty tricks is beginning to die
down a bit. Vereli is needed for that, and he has
something else in his head now. Vinzi has made
him a pipe, which he has wanted for ages, and he
is so determined to learn how to play that nothing
will stop him. You know that if he wants a
thing he never gives up till he has it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those pipes are a real blessing for the whole
mountain, it seems to me. They are toning
down even the worst boys,&#8221; said the mother,
comfortably leaning back in her chair. She knew
what peace it had brought to her own evenings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and was already waiting for the tones of the pipe
which so quieted them.</p>

<p>When the boys were ready to set out to the
pasture with their cattle next morning, the uncle
said to Vinzi. &#8220;Go right up to the tower, for
the grandfather is sure to be up by now. He
sits from early morning till evening on the bench
before his house sunning himself. You will have
to judge when it will be time to leave. Be sure to
stay as long as he wants you to.&#8221;</p>

<p>They set out, Russli, as usual, staying a little
behind Vinzi. He had attentively listened to his
father&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must come back soon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
must come down as soon as you have played
something for the grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear what your father said,
Russli?&#8221; retorted Vinzi. &#8220;I have to do what
the grandfather wants me to. I&#8217;ll have to stay
all morning if he wishes me to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll tickle the cows again,&#8221; Russli
asserted grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is wicked of you, Russli,&#8221; cried out
Vinzi full of indignation. &#8220;I always thought
that you were a nice boy. Didn&#8217;t I stay with
you all the time and tell you all sorts of stories?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Didn&#8217;t I play for you as much as ever you wanted
me to? I never believed Faz when he told me
naughty things about you and now I find that
what I thought untrue was true after all. Do
you know what I am going to do? I&#8217;ll stay with
Jos and Faz from now on and you can stay by
yourself and I&#8217;ll never come near you any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I won&#8217;t do it,&#8221; said Russli, half obstinately
and half repentantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Russli,&#8221; said Vinzi, already
reconciled, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll promise to cut you something
on the way every time I leave you. What
do you want? A walking stick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; came the decided answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want a flag-pole?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A pipe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I gave you one ages ago,&#8221; suggested
Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. I want a pipe and then
another and still another every time you want to
make me something,&#8221; Russli said stubbornly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, you shall have a pipe,&#8221; Vinzi
promised.</p>

<p>When the boys came to the pasture they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
turned their herd to the right of the road towards
the larch trees. But Vinzi continued on his way.
Every time his three cousins called to him,
&#8220;Come back soon,&#8221; he answered by waving his
cap to them. He felt so well and strong now
that he threw his cap high into the air and caught
it again with a loud shout. Vinzi had never been
so wonderfully happy before. The sun was shining
from a cloudless sky over the green fields,
pastures and rugged mountains, against which
the dark spruces were sharply outlined. He
remembered having come that way, but how
different it all looked now! The scene constantly
grew more entrancing. The high snow-mountain
stood out completely behind the
wooded heights, and its great and mighty summit
shimmered faintly in the sunlight. Suddenly a
miracle seemed to happen. A broad stream,
gleaming like silver in the early morning light,
spread right across the whole mountain, but it
made not a sound or motion. It was not rushing
water, but a glorious, broad glacier. Vinzi had
to stand still as he watched a strange blue fire
flash across the expanse. He lingered a while,
unable to go further. How strange that he
should not have taken in all this beauty before!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>Going on again he was repaid by hearing
sounds as of a rustling wood in the distance. He
wondered what it might be, because he knew that
there was no forest here. Foaming white and
roaring loudly, there suddenly appeared before
him a waterfall which leaped down over steep
rocks and right across the way he saw a second.
Here and there gurgling mountain streams
rushed down from the rocky walls, and the air
that blew into his face was so deliciously fresh
that he had to pause again and take deep breaths.
But what was the glowing red field which
stretched a short distance from him down the
slope? Eagerly Vinzi ran along as if he had
wings and the bracing air made him forget how
steep was the slope he was climbing.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as the road made a curve, the red
field would vanish for a while only to reappear
again much nearer and still more brilliant in the
sunlight. Now a well-known sound of cow-bells
greeted his ears, and he wondered where the
cattle were.</p>

<p>He had to stop again in order to look about
him. At his left, below the road he could see the
herd peacefully grazing in a fresh green meadow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
He saw cows of different colors and quite a
number of boys. Some lay flat on the ground
while others stood together in little groups. In
the middle of the valley rose a gray stone tower.
That was the old tower he had seen on his trip
and his cousins had described to him. Also the
grandfather sat leaning his back against the
ancient walls exactly as his uncle Lorenz had told
him he would do. The old man with the bright
sun shining down upon him was gazing up at the
blue sky. He wore no hat on his snow-white
head and a heavy white beard fell down to his
chest. The old man sitting in the sun with the
cows quietly grazing about him made the most
peaceful scene. Even the old tower which had
frightened him so seemed to be quite a cosy
abode, and Vinzi could picture all the Tower
Boys leading a very happy existence there with
the grandfather. He was anxious to inspect it
from near, but first he had to see the red
mountain-side. It could not be far from
here now.</p>

<p>Vinzi hurried along. After a curve of the
road the red, sparkling field lay before him.</p>

<p>Climbing over the rocky edge of the road, he
went deep into the green leaves which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
covered with bright red alpine roses. They
spread over the whole slope as far as he could
see, and he could not help saying, &#8220;How beautiful!&#8221;
to himself, over and over again.</p>

<p>Carefully going on, he discovered a little spot
free of plants. Here he could sit down in the
middle of the flowers without hurting them. In
silent rapture he gazed at the glory about him.</p>

<p>The sun was beating down from a cloudless
sky but the fresh mountain breeze fanned his
cheek and made him bless the hot rays. The dark
blue sky stretched close over the gleaming field
of roses, the gray ranges and green, sunny slopes.
The mighty snow peak opposite rose high into
the air and thundering streams flung their snow-white
foam sunwards, so that they sparkled in a
thousand colors.</p>

<p>Vinzi must have been sitting there dreaming
a long while. Suddenly he became conscious of
the sun being nearly above his head, which meant
that it was practically noon. Starting up at
once, he ran in big leaps over the flowery field,
putting his feet down so that he did not crush a
single rose. Then he crossed the road and still
kept on running across the other meadow to the
old tower. Vinzi planted himself immediately in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
front of the grandfather, who was still sitting on
his wind-sheltered bench in the sunshine. But he
had to take a deep breath before he could attempt
to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, boy? Why are you in such a
hurry?&#8221; calmly asked the grandfather.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a bit late. I meant to be here much
sooner,&#8221; replied the boy, having at last gained his
breath. &#8220;Black Vereli sent me here because you
wanted to hear me play the pipe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see, you are the boy who carves the
pipes and who is supposed to play so well,&#8221; said
the old man. &#8220;It is nice of you to come here.
Sit down beside me on the bench and tell me where
you come from and to whom you belong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi, after sitting down, told the old man
about his family and that he was staying for a
while with his uncle Lorenz Lesa.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know him,&#8221; said the grandfather. &#8220;He is
a splendid man. Did he object to your coming
up here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi answered that his uncle had bidden him
to go and stay as long as the grandfather wished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am glad; then you can play something
for me. But I think we had better have some
food first.&#8221; With these words the old man rose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
but changing his mind suddenly, he resumed his
seat again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it would be unseemly if the
young one brought the lunch while the old one remained
seated,&#8221; he said, kindly patting Vinzi&#8217;s
shoulder. &#8220;Go around the corner here, open the
door and go to the shelf. You&#8217;ll find a jug of
milk and everything else ready. Go and bring it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi was gone in a minute and quickly returned
with the required articles. The food was
placed between them on the bench and the grandfather
cut pieces of bread and cheese, inviting
Vinzi to do the same.</p>

<p>But the boy slightly hesitated. All morning
he had done only what he had felt like doing, instead
of coming early and playing to the grandfather.
Therefore he could not begin with a
clear conscience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat, eat, boy! What&#8217;s the matter? There
is more than enough for us both. Why don&#8217;t you
begin?&#8221; asked the old man after a while with such
a kindly glance from his eyes that Vinzi would
have felt like doing a more difficult bidding.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you like it here on our mountain?&#8221;
asked the old man after a little while.</p>

<p>Vinzi&#8217;s eyes fairly flashed. &#8220;Oh, it is wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
here. I never saw anything more beautiful
in my life!&#8221; he exclaimed, still filled with his
recent impressions.</p>

<p>At this the grandfather patted him on the
back again. &#8220;Neither did I, neither did I,&#8221; he
said full of satisfaction. &#8220;You think just what
I think. I&#8217;d like to know where it could be finer.
Where do they have such golden sunshine as we
have up here and pure air like that which simply
fills one with health? Every one can breathe as
much of it, too, as he can hold. And what strength
this air and sunshine give one! I tell you I know
something about it. Of course my strength is
beginning to give out a bit. I am still well but
not young any more. How old do you think I
am, boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe seventy,&#8221; said Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho, is that what you think! I was seventy
twenty and a few odd years ago and I was young
still at that time. I thought nothing of going
with heavy loads on my back down into the valley
and coming up again with more. But I can&#8217;t do
such things now, and no more do they want me to.
All the young people ask of me is to keep peace
among the boys while they stay in the tower during
summer. They are on the pasture during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
day, but when they come home in the evening
they need some one to keep them in order; otherwise
things go amiss. I sit here in the sunshine
all day and that gives me ample time to think over
all the blessings I have to thank our Lord in
Heaven for during my long life. Since I passed
my ninetieth year I do not count any more. I
take every fine day as a splendid gift and looking
up to Heaven in the evening, I say from the
bottom of my heart, &#8216;Thanks for it, good Father
in Heaven, thanks!&#8217; And when the time comes
for me to go, I won&#8217;t have far to go. Look what
a short distance I will have to fly. That&#8217;s one of
the reasons I love it here on the mountain. It&#8217;s
very close to Heaven and so open that one can
look about in all directions. One&#8217;s thoughts easily
strive upwards and make one happy, either living
or dying.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi had followed the grandfather&#8217;s words
with keen attention. The boy was sorry when the
speaker was silent at last, for he would have liked
to know much more about the grandfather&#8217;s
solitary existence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you thinking about so earnestly?&#8221;
asked the grandfather after a considerable silence
between them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&#8220;I was longing for you to tell me about your
life in winter when the boys have gone home. I
wonder if you stay in the tower all alone or if you
have to leave despite your being so happy here,&#8221;
replied Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not gone to the valley for at least ten
years and I do not care to,&#8221; said the grandfather,
inhaling a deep breath of the sunny mountain air.
&#8220;I could neither stand the heavy air nor the
crowds of people who get in each other&#8217;s way. I
don&#8217;t have to live alone in the tower because the
monks in the hospice up there are my good
friends. You know where it is, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Vinzi, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t even know
what kind of place it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a good place,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;They
receive there in winter poor travellers who cannot
go on for the cold and the masses of snow, and
whom they often find lying outside half frozen.
The good monks who live in the hospice fetch
them in to a warm fire, then give them strengthening
food and drink till they are able to travel on
their way. They are my very best friends, and
when the boys drive the cattle home in the
autumn, I go up to live with them. You may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
have seen the hospice, for it is just a little way up
in that direction.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I remember it now,&#8221; exclaimed
Vinzi, for the picture of a big stone house on the
road rose before him. He remembered having
seen it on his walk and he recalled how still and
dead everything about it had seemed, exactly as
if no one lived there.</p>

<p>&#8220;A warm chimney corner is always ready for
me there,&#8221; continued the old man. &#8220;I sit there
all winter long and hear many a good word from
the monks. Once in a while I see a poor wretch
who would have perished miserably but for their
help. After being cared for he is able to take up
his load again with fresh courage. I hear things
about the world once in a while that make me glad
that I am so far away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can well believe it,&#8221; replied Vinzi
understandingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How would it be if we made a little music
now?&#8221; asked the grandfather after a pause.
Then he set the empty pitcher, the plate and knife
under the bench in order to make more room.
&#8220;What would you like best to play?&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_156fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">VINZI, TAKING UP HIS PIPE, HAD BEGUN TO PLAY A MELODY</p>

<p>Vinzi, taking up his pipe, had begun to play
a melody.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>It pleased his listener so much that he had to
repeat it straightway. As soon as he had finished
it the second time the grandfather said, &#8220;That
was a beautiful thing. Was it a hymn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you learn that? Boys usually
whistle quite different tunes. Where did you find
it?&#8221; the old man wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t find it. I play the tune as I hear it
sung. Mother sings such a song with us at home
every night,&#8221; Vinzi declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know more like that?&#8221; the grandfather
inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, lots more,&#8221; Vinzi assured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to know if you could play me a song
I heard only once in my life. I would give a
great deal if I could hear it again. But all I
know about it is the refrain at the end of each
verse; perhaps you could recognize it from that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be better if you could sing me parts
of it,&#8221; said Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, boy, I can&#8217;t sing any more,&#8221; the
grandfather remonstrated, &#8220;but I can tell you
what the song was about and how the ending
went. You see I was not always as happy as I
am now. Of course when I was young like you I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
was happy, for I had a mother who watched over
me as yours apparently does who teaches you such
nice songs. My father was dead and I had comrades
who wanted me to go out with them into
the world to seek adventures. As I wanted to
go so much, I had to do it against her will. We
went and travelled far, sometimes as soldiers,
sometimes as workmen. It was a wild life, but
you couldn&#8217;t understand that yet. Finally, I
couldn&#8217;t bear it any longer. I begged them to
turn back and start a new existence. But they
would not hear of it, so I returned alone. It had
been a long time since I had written to my mother
or heard from her. When I came home I found
that she was dead. &#8216;She wouldn&#8217;t have gotten
sick if you had stayed at home,&#8217; our neighbor said
to me. These words were deeply burnt into my
soul. I wanted to begin a new life and redeem
myself. But I could find no joy in anything.
My conscience constantly reproached me and
troubled me, and I realized I could never atone
for her death. One night when I couldn&#8217;t sleep
for remorse I cried aloud to Heaven: &#8216;Oh,
mother, you were always ready to help me
before! Please help me now, or don&#8217;t I deserve
it?&#8217; On awakening in the morning I clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
heard my mother&#8217;s voice saying, &#8216;Go to church,
Klaus, the bells are ringing.&#8217; She had always
said this to me every Sunday morning during
her life-time. I jumped out of bed and found
that it was really Sunday. I hadn&#8217;t been to
church for a long while, but that day I went
again. At first I could not follow the pastor&#8217;s
words. But suddenly I heard, &#8216;And our Lord
came down from Heaven to bring us mercy and
forgiveness and keep us from perishing in our
misery. And He gave us back our joy!&#8217; That
was clearly meant for me and it went through
me like a ray of sunshine. Then came the song
I spoke of. I could understand every word of it
because it told exactly how I felt at that moment.
At the end of every verse came the following
refrain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8216;For the blessed song of mercy</div>
<div class="verse">Thrills our hearts forevermore.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;I have never forgotten it. From then on
I went to church whenever the bells called
me and I heard many comforting words there
that made me glad again. Do you think you
could play me the song now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi would gladly have done the grandfather&#8217;s
bidding, but he did not know the song.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>&#8220;Then play me one of your own, I love to hear
them, too,&#8221; said the grandfather comfortingly,
for he realized the boy was not able to fulfil
his wish.</p>

<p>Vinzi did so willingly and kept playing one
piece after the other until loud calls and cries
from the distance showed him that the boys were
starting to come home.</p>

<p>Quickly rising, Vinzi asked the grandfather&#8217;s
leave to go. The latter agreed that it was high
time. He could not comprehend, however, how
quickly the afternoon had flown. &#8220;Can you come
soon again?&#8221; he asked, and added, &#8220;Please tell
your uncle Lorenz that I shall expect you soon
again. Just let me say one more word. I wish
you could teach our boys to play, too. That
would give me something worth hearing when
you are gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi told the old man that he was already
teaching them. Unfortunately they always failed
to play the melodies smoothly. They were much
better at singing and quickly learned to sing
new songs.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, teach them some of your songs
then. I suppose that you know others beside
the hymns?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, I have heard some from uncle Lorenz.
If I only had words to one I know, I could teach
them that,&#8221; answered Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are like me. I forget the words,
too, but you are still too young to do that,&#8221; was
the old man&#8217;s opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t forgotten them. I never knew
them,&#8221; said Vinzi seriously.</p>

<p>The old man measured him with a penetrating
glance, trying to see if this was meant to be a joke.
But Vinzi looked far too earnest. &#8220;How can you
know a song if it has no words?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know a few words of it and the way it
should sound, but it is so hard to make up enough
words for a whole song, and I can&#8217;t do it. When
I was sitting among the roses this morning, I
heard the song and I could sing it, except for the
words. If only some one could write me a song.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi looked longingly up to the grandfather.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I know a person who could do it,&#8221;
replied the latter, very pleased at the possibility
of helping Vinzi. &#8220;What would your song
be about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About the alp-roses and the sunshine on
them. The sunshine on the mountains and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
foaming water and all the beautiful things I
saw there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi&#8217;s eyes sparkled as he eagerly described
this. The melody he had heard kept going in his
head and he could barely keep himself from singing
it aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let Pater Silvanus know about this and
we&#8217;ll see what he can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this the grandfather shook Vinzi&#8217;s hand
once more. Then the boy ran down the mountain
without stopping once till he had reached his
uncle&#8217;s house. Loud cries came from the pump
where his three cousins were just going through
their daily ablution. All rushed towards him and
wanted to know what he had done all day, at the
same time telling him about their own happenings.
In the middle of it all Russli pulled his
jacket confidentially, for he had an important
communication to make. Finally, he was able to
make himself heard. &#8220;I did not pinch any all
day, not even one.&#8221;</p>

<p>For reward Vinzi drew a beautiful new pipe
from his pocket.</p>

<p>Vinzi had acquired such skill in carving pipes
that he had rapidly made it that morning while
sitting among the roses.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>Uncle Lorenz and his aunt greeted him as
heartily as if they had not seen him for a long
while. After he had given the grandfather&#8217;s
message to his uncle, the latter replied, &#8220;Yes, yes,
go up there as often as you please, only be sure
to come home to us in the evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>The aunt joined in, too, adding, &#8220;It would
suit me best if things should never change and
Vinzi could stay with us always.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Vinzi soon after sat on his threshold he
had a great many things to think over. His
thoughts kept him so busy that he would have
liked to dispense with sleeping altogether and sit
there all night.</p>

<p>He was still filled with the grandfather&#8217;s
story, which had made a tremendous impression
upon him. While listening to it he had had an
idea, which since then had grown more vivid.
Now the time seemed to have come to carry it out.</p>

<p>Raising the pipe to his lips he quietly began to
play to himself. Sometimes he paused, silently
listening to what he heard. Then he hummed
again as the melodies were slowly taking shape.
Vinzi looked about him. All the houses round
about were dark, but all the stars sparkled down
on him so radiantly that he finally grew silent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
looked in pious awe at the joyfully gleaming
sky above.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, now I know it!&#8221; he cried suddenly.
Raising his pipe again he lured from it the most
tripping, happy tunes. Quite satisfied he at last
closed his little door and lay happily down on his
fragrant couch of hay.</p>

<p>The music seemed really to begin now, for he
felt that whole choruses of angels were singing
down to him from the shining stars. But Vinzi
only heard this in his slumbers, for as soon as he
had touched his pillow he was fast asleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>STILL MORE MUSIC</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">A GREAT song rehearsal now took place
every day on the pasture. Vinzi had
formed a chorus of all the boys having
good voices. Some, of course, could not sing,
while others did not care to do it; also some of the
cow-herds had to remain with the cattle. The rehearsals
took up a lot of time because Vinzi demanded
the little bit he taught them every day
should be perfectly sung. He could not bear
false notes and whenever he heard one he cried
out as if a wasp had stung him. He then made
them repeat the whole passage again. Vinzi had
long known that Jos and Vereli had the best and
truest voices and so he chose Jos as leader for the
high voices and Vereli for the alto voices. Besides
doing splendid work in singing, the two boys
proved most helpful in keeping the other singers
in order. When any of the boys knew anything
by heart, they wished to sing right out as soon as
Vinzi began to play. But Jos and Vereli realized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
that this would not do, so they had to restrain the
eager singers till their time came.</p>

<p>The following Sunday had been chosen by
Vinzi for the performance. He would have
gladly waited, if it had been necessary, but his
chorus was perfectly trained. It was the most
suitable day in the week, as most of the boys had
their freedom that afternoon.</p>

<p>Jos and Vinzi wandered up the mountain-side
with their little troupe of singers. On their
journey up, other boys from neighboring cottages
joined them. Many even wanted to go along as
listeners. In that way a considerable number had
gathered together before they all approached
the tower.</p>

<p>The grandfather was sitting, as usual, in the
sunshine on his bench, and a cool mountain breeze
was fanning his deeply-tinted cheeks. He looked
questioningly at the approaching boys. Vinzi,
Jos and Vereli, the leaders, came to within a few
feet of the old man, and the others grouped themselves
about in a semi-circle. Now Vinzi began
to play. At first he seemed to begin a gay tune,
but soon the instrument took up a sad and serious
air. Finally the tones seemed to weep and sob as
if some one were pleading for mercy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>At this point the chorus took up the following
words, quietly giving a ray of hope:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;But the blessed song of mercy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lamenting tones of the pipe vibrated anew till
the chorus sang a second time, this time louder and
in fuller tones:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;But the blessed song of mercy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the pipe took up its pleading melody,
but the chorus now took up the refrain with full
strength and the words this time sounded like the
veriest jubilation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;But the blessed song of mercy</div>
<div class="verse">Resounds through all eternity.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The pipe joined in here with notes of triumph,
and together with the voices all ended in a happy
song of joy.</p>

<p>Everything was quiet as the grandfather sat
motionless with his hands folded on his knees.
One of the boys started to run away, then more
followed, and soon all of them were hurrying
towards the green meadow where the cows from
the valley were grazing. Here they found their
comrades who were in charge of the cattle. Vereli
alone had remained beside Jos and Vinzi, but he
also disappeared, because such quiet was not long
to his taste.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>When the grandfather raised his glance he
seemed to return from some far-away place.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sang me a beautiful song,&#8221; he said
kindly. &#8220;Where did you find it? I suppose
you taught it to the others, Vinzi?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got the idea from you,&#8221; replied Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm, hm,&#8221; said the grandfather, &#8220;you seem
to comprehend pretty well what one says to you.
But where did you find the music?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It came to me because I wanted to sing you
the song you could not remember,&#8221; said Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very good of you to give an old man
such pleasure. But wait! I nearly forgot something,&#8221;
said the grandfather, searching about in
his pockets. &#8220;I have thought of you, too, for I
told Pater Silvanus about your wanting a certain
kind of song. You can see how good he is, for
look! he brought it to me. The only condition he
made is that you are to sing him the song when you
have found the tune for it. Oh, here it is at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grandfather now pulled out a long sheet
of paper, which he gave to Vinzi. A song was
written on it in firm large letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to say something else, boys,&#8221; continued
the grandfather. &#8220;Jos, you know where
the cellar is. Bring me the cheese which has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
cut, and one of the largest loaves of bread. Vinzi
must go with you, because it is too heavy for you
alone. Take it down to the boys who have sung
for me today. You can have a little feast together,
for you have made one for me, too. Take
a cup out of the kitchen so you can take turns
drinking. Xaver can milk for you the cows that
give the best milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grandfather always called Vereli by his
real name, for the boy&#8217;s father and grandfather
had been called the same before him.</p>

<p>The two now ran away to do his bidding and
found themselves puffing hard under their load
while climbing the cellar-stairs. But they did so
with radiant faces, for they happily looked forward
to arriving at the pasture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come again, boys,&#8221; said the grandfather,
gratefully shaking their hands. &#8220;Make some
other Sunday happy for me sometime with your
beautiful singing.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the singers had remained on the huge
pasture with the Tower Boys, and yells of delight
greeted the laden couple. They settled down immediately
to begin the feast. Their appetites
proved astonishing, for many of the boys from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
small cottages thereabout usually got only potatoes
for their daily fare.</p>

<p>Vinzi had settled a little behind the close circle.
He wished to be alone in order to read the words
of his song. The melody was still haunting him,
and he wondered if the words and music would
harmonize. Pulling out the paper, he found that
he could read the fine clear writing without
trouble. He read it over and over again. Suddenly
a terrific longing drew him up to the field
of roses, a longing which he found impossible to
resist. Getting up, he quietly slipped away from
the busy feast-makers. Without stopping he ran
up the slope into the midst of the marvellous rose
field and settled down on his chosen spot, surrounded
on every side by thick clumps of bloom.
Here he could hear his song again and sing it to
himself. He pulled out his sheet and read:</p>

<p>That evening Vinzi came tearing down the
mountain-side so late that the whole family had
been gathered together before the house looking
for him on every side. Jos had returned several
hours ago and had related to them the grandfather&#8217;s
delight at the music, also how he had
treated them to a feast and how Vinzi had suddenly
disappeared, no one knew whither. They
had all vainly guessed where he might be. One
member of the family after another had gone outside
to see if he was coming home, till finally all of
them were on the lookout. He came running
along at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vinzi, Vinzi,&#8221; the uncle called to him, &#8220;we
almost thought you had run away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll never do that,&#8221; Vinzi assured him,
panting hard. &#8220;I was sitting among the alpine-roses
and entirely forgot the time.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;d do just the opposite,&#8221; declared Faz. &#8220;If
I had to sit up there away from everybody and
with not even a cow to talk to, I&#8217;d have to think all
the time, I wonder how late it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you made some pipes?&#8221; Russli
wanted to find out.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Russli, I&#8217;ll make some more tomorrow,&#8221;
Vinzi replied with understanding.</p>

<p>The father urged them to go into the house,
for he longed for a little Sunday music, and first
of all for supper, because the mother had refused
to give them any till Vinzi should come back.
They were all very hungry.</p>

<p>During the next few days Vinzi spent many
a happy hour in his beloved rose field, which he
could do with a clear conscience. Jos knew what
was going on and he saw to it that Vinzi got the
fine morning hours to himself. He therefore sent
him up as soon as they reached the pasture, for he
was dreadfully eager to learn a new song. After a
few days Vinzi called his chorus together, and by
this time they made such rapid progress that he
had to wonder at them. All they had to do was
to follow the melody the pipe was playing, which
was most pleasing, besides being easy to remember.
The chorus sang with great enthusiasm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
for the words were easily understood and
stayed in their memory without difficulty. They
always hated to stop when the time came. Vinzi
had only to accompany the song a few times with
Jos and Vereli as leaders and all the boys on every
pasture could sing it.</p>

<p>When they got together in the morning one
would cry to the other: &#8220;Let&#8217;s sing our song,&#8221; for
they fully felt that it was their very own.</p>

<p>When Sunday came, all the musicians proceeded
up to the grandfather, who having already
got wind of the affair, looked forward eagerly to
their visit. The number was even larger than the
first time, and the performers in their eagerness
had barely reached his bench when they began
their song. The volume of their voices increased
till the end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravo, bravo!&#8221; exclaimed the grandfather
delighted. &#8220;Once more! Once more!&#8221;</p>

<p>With undiminished enthusiasm the whole performance
was repeated.</p>

<p>When Vinzi saw that the singers went on
smoothly without him, he signalled to Jos and
Vereli. Lightly as lizards the three slipped
quickly away.</p>

<p>This had been planned beforehand, for Vinzi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was eager to do what the grandfather had bidden
him do; but as he was convinced that so much
noise would be unseemly for the hospice, he had
decided not to let the others know where he was
going. If they had known, he probably could not
have prevented the boys from running after them.</p>

<p>As soon as they had reached the road, the three
boys were able to wander along a little more
slowly, and they soon saw the large building of
stone which Vinzi remembered so clearly. What
a terrible impression it had made on him! How
silently it lay there, and how frightened he had
been when he had thought it might be his uncle&#8217;s
home! How different it looked now as it lay
peacefully in the sunshine, and seemed even to
beckon to the boys! Vinzi knew now that here
lived the good monks who helped half-frozen
travellers in winter as they struggled up the
mountain in bad weather. When they stood before
the door, Vereli pulled the bell-rope so
mightily that they could hear it re-echo inside.
Soon after a very small old man opened the heavy
door a trifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the porter,&#8221; said Vereli.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; asked the old man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>&#8220;We want to see Pater Silvanus,&#8221; quickly
replied Vereli.</p>

<p>The old man, after examining the three suspiciously,
said finally in a measured tone: &#8220;Well,
boys, Pater Silvanus can&#8217;t be brought out for a
joke. He has usually very different customers
from you. What do you want from him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had better go if Pater Silvanus has no
time for us,&#8221; said Vinzi timidly.</p>

<p>But Vereli could not be disposed of so easily.
&#8220;We have a message for him from grandfather,&#8221;
he said unruffled. &#8220;Grandfather told us to give it
to Pater Silvanus himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the old man opened the door a little
wider and let the three boys enter. &#8220;You can
wait here,&#8221; he said curtly, leaving them and going
down a dim, long corridor, where they could still
hear his dragging footsteps after they could not
see him any more.</p>

<p>After a while a firm and rapid step came
towards them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here he comes,&#8221; said Vereli, unabashed,
when the monk with a long garment stood
before them and examined them with penetrating
glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are one of the boys from the tower, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
carry their stamp about you,&#8221; he said, turning to
Vereli. &#8220;And who are your companions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He belongs to Lorenz Lesa, near the chapel,
and he is his cousin, Vinzi Lesa, from Leuk,&#8221;
explained Vereli.</p>

<p>A curious smile flitted over the monk&#8217;s features
at the mention of the last name. Looking
at Vinzi once more, he said pleasantly, &#8220;Come
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he led them through the long, echoing
corridor, and after opening a door in the rear,
bade them enter. It was a very large room with
dark panelled walls, against which ancient leather
chairs with high backs were ranged. In the
middle of it stood a huge square table, but Vinzi
could not take his eyes from an object he had
noticed in a corner. It looked slightly like a high
cupboard and somewhat resembled Alida&#8217;s piano,
but was a trifle higher. Standing in front of the
trio, the monk asked the grandfather&#8217;s wishes.</p>

<p>Vinzi felt that it was for him to speak. He
expressed himself as willing to sing the song
which the kind Father had sent him through
the grandfather.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, I&#8217;ll be glad to hear it,&#8221; said the monk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Upon noticing that Vinzi still hesitated, he added:
&#8220;What else do you want to ask me, boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I sing it or may I play?&#8221; asked Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Play, for I must hear your pipe,&#8221; Pater
Silvanus replied with a friendly smile.</p>

<p>They lost no time and began. Vinzi, entirely
sure of his two singers and much encouraged by
the monk&#8217;s great kindness, played, not the
melody, but a little accompaniment which he had
practiced for himself.</p>

<p>At the end of the song Pater Silvanus glanced
at Vinzi affectionately. Then laying his hand on
the boy&#8217;s shoulder and looking him in the eyes he
said, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to know something, boy, and you
must be sure to tell me the truth. Have you ever
heard this melody before or one that was a little
like it to some other words?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it belongs to this song. I only found it
when I got your words from the grandfather,&#8221;
Vinzi replied guilelessly, looking up at the questioner
with wide, honest eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to hear the song once more,&#8221; said the
monk. &#8220;Don&#8217;t leave out either the verses or
the accompaniment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three began again, happily, for to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
asked to repeat it was a sign that it had pleased
the monk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Pater Silvanus, when they had
come to the end, &#8220;You must hear how my harmonium
sounds to it. I wonder if you&#8217;ll like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Going up to the big high box, he opened it and
began to play.</p>

<p>Vinzi listened breathlessly. What wonderful
deeply gripping tones! His whole heart
was shaken.</p>

<p>And was it possible? It sounded so strangely
familiar; yes, it was his own melody with the
accompaniment the pipe had played. But how
different, how full and rich!</p>

<p>Vinzi stood still in silent rapture when the
tones had died away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that was beautiful, much more beautiful
than our music,&#8221; he said, quite carried away with
the beautiful sounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was your song, boy, and I did not have
to add much,&#8221; said the monk kindly. &#8220;Come
nearer; have you never before heard such
an instrument?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Vinzi, after stepping quite
near to the harmonium. &#8220;But I have heard
a piano.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>The monk asked Vinzi what music he had
heard on the piano and Vinzi related the story of
the short music lessons which he had enjoyed
so much.</p>

<p>Stroking Vinzi&#8217;s curly hair a few times, the
monk smiled sympathetically. Then he asked,
&#8220;Do you think you would get pleasure from
learning how to play my instrument?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi hardly knew if he had heard aright, he
was so thrilled. With glowing eyes he looked
silently at the monk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose you mean yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand times yes,&#8221; Vinzi finally was
able to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Tell your uncle Lorenz about it
and let me know tomorrow morning what he says.
If he doesn&#8217;t object, we can play a little
every morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Giving his hand to the boys, Pater Silvanus,
after saying a kind word to each of them in turn,
opened the door and let them out, and they
strolled gaily down the mountain-side. Vinzi
was walking in a perfect dream beside his companions,
who were both talking with animation.
He kept on hearing Pater Silvanus&#8217; words,
&#8220;Would you get pleasure from learning how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
play my instrument?&#8221; Give him pleasure? It
was a happiness he could hardly comprehend.</p>

<p>Vereli had turned off and gone back to the
tower without Vinzi&#8217;s noticing it, and before long
the other two were home. During supper time
Jos related to his parents how friendly Pater
Silvanus had been and what he had proposed to
do for Vinzi, if his father did not object.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said the latter at once, &#8220;I
am glad that Vinzi has the chance to learn something
fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Early next morning Vinzi came to Pater
Silvanus and repeated his uncle&#8217;s words with a
radiant face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us begin at once,&#8221; said the monk,
leading the boy to the great room with the
harmonium.</p>

<p>These lessons differed considerably from
Alida&#8217;s, and the teacher seemed to forget the time
as much as his pupil. One hour and a second
hour had gone by, when the sudden sound of a
bell reminded Pater Silvanus how late it really
was. Quickly closing his instrument and giving
the boy his hand, he said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll go on tomorrow,
but be sure to come as early as today.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi went away so filled with happiness that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
he must run right over to the grandfather and tell
him all the wonderful and unexpected things that
had happened to him. No one could have been
able to share his joy better than the grandfather,
who was as pleased as if it had all happened
to him.</p>

<p>Vinzi told of everything that the Pater had
already explained and taught him, and he did not
leave without giving his solemn promise often to
bring reports of his progress and at the same
time pipe the old man a little song. A glorious
succession of days followed for Vinzi, and the
further Pater Silvanus took him the more his
burning desire grew to get still further. Pater
Silvanus himself seemed to find pleasure in the
lessons, for he taught his pupil every morning,
and sometimes the lessons lasted fully three hours.
When the monk had to leave for other duties, he
let Vinzi stay and practice what he had prepared
with him. The boy sat many an hour in the quiet
house. No noise ever interrupted him, and the
time flew by unnoticed. When the sun finally
slanted across the harmonium through a certain
window, he knew that evening was near. Quickly
shutting the instrument, he noiselessly went down
the long corridor and out to the road. This gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
him time enough to visit the grandfather and find
his cousins and their comrades still gathered together.
He was greeted with fresh enthusiasm
every time. A chorus of various frightful noises
always followed his arrival, because every owner
of a pipe wanted to show him what he had learned
to play. Vinzi could not help wondering at the
number of boys who owned pipes since he had left
the pasture. The boys had possibly found out
how to make them themselves.</p>

<p>His bargain with Russli had been firmly kept.
Every morning going up or in the evening coming
home the little one was inseparable from Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Russli, you have enough pipes now,&#8221; said
Vinzi one day while he was wandering home with
his little comrade behind the cows. He had just
delivered his daily pipe and added: &#8220;In all this
time you should have learnt not to tickle the cows,
Russli, without always expecting a reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so I have,&#8221; Russli agreed, &#8220;Because I
have so much to do nowadays.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi could not help wondering at Russli&#8217;s
quick response; in fact all the little boy&#8217;s mischievous
deeds had really come only from idleness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What keeps you so busy?&#8221; asked Vinzi.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show it to you, but no one else must know
about it,&#8221; replied Russli mysteriously.</p>

<p>He led Vinzi away from the road to the old
larch trees, where the two used to sit in the old
days when Vinzi had made his first pipes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me something, Russli,&#8221; Vinzi began
again, &#8220;did you put all your pipes in a pile together
or did you give them to the boys who had
none. So many have good pipes now and not the
kind they used to make themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t ever give away my beautiful pipes,&#8221;
replied Russli, quite hurt at a supposition throwing
doubt on the sensibleness of his actions.
&#8220;Come, you can see for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were standing at the exact place where
Vinzi used to sit on a high mossy place beside the
fragrant violets. Stooping down, Russli picked
up several pieces of moss-covered earth which lay
there cleverly joined together. He put them
aside and shovelled away the loose earth underneath
with both hands, disclosing a rather large
hole. After lifting out a strong folded paper
serving as cover, Russli asked his companion to
look in. To his intense surprise Vinzi saw a collection
of most varied objects: piles of nuts and
dried prunes, match boxes, colored marbles, old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
knives and tobacco boxes, a little pump, a leather
purse and a watch-chain of brass.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this, Russli? To whom do all these
things belong?&#8221; asked Vinzi, truly astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;They all belong to me. I traded one of
these things for every pipe you gave me. Do you
see now?&#8221; asked Russli, proudly glancing at
his storehouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what are you going to do with them
all?&#8221; Vinzi inquired, still puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep them and then I&#8217;ll trade them
again for something better. You see the pipes
are only common wood, after all,&#8221; Russli said
confidentially.</p>

<p>Vinzi had to laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must become a tradesman, Russli, for
you seem to understand all about it. But you
won&#8217;t have anything more to do now, since our
bargain is off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I&#8217;ll have just as much work as ever.
I first uncover my hole every morning, dig away
the earth and count everything to see if anything
has been stolen in the night. Then I have to pack
and cover them up and put on the moss in such a
way that no one can find the place. In the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
I have to sit on the lookout so that no one
finds my cave and takes my things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi could not comprehend these watchful
exertions on behalf of such treasure, for he totally
lacked the tradesman&#8217;s spirit. He was glad, however,
that this new activity kept the little fellow
busy. He was convinced that he would leave the
cows in peace now, even without his usual reward.</p>

<p>The month of August had passed and the first
fog was drifting over the mountains. Several
times messages had been brought up from Leuk
to say that the time was drawing near for Vinzi
to come home. The boy&#8217;s parents felt that they
had taken advantage of their relatives&#8217; kindness
long enough and they begged their cousin to take
the next opportunity of sending the boy home
with someone. Word had always been sent back
to Leuk to the effect that the summer was not
over and that no one wanted to let Vinzi go.
Furthermore he was so well and happy that the
parents might let him prolong his stay on the
mountain. Father Lorenz was just entering the
room where his wife was preparing the evening
meal with her accustomed calm. He sat down on
a chair, for no special work had to be done till the
boys returned with the cattle and after a moment&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
thought, said, &#8220;Have you noticed how
much Vinzi has changed lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; asked his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems suddenly to have grown a whole
year or two older,&#8221; said Lorenz, &#8220;ever since he
began to spend most of his time with Pater
Silvanus. I notice it in the way he plays his pipe
and the way he sings and talks. It is as if the boy
had been transplanted from the shadow into the
sunshine. Everything in him seems to have
blossomed out suddenly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand what you mean,&#8221;
replied the woman, &#8220;but I always said that Vinzi
looks as fresh and neat as a young appletree in
bloom. And I say another thing besides. If
Vinzi were a beggar-boy, I&#8217;d adopt him right
away and I&#8217;d love him just as much as my own
boys. I can say that and I&#8217;ll stick to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so you can,&#8221; said the man with a smile.
&#8220;But do you know, if Vinzi had been a vagabond
without the kind of mother they say he has, he
would never have been the same. He belongs to
a well-brought-up family and comes from parents
who look after their children. That&#8217;s the reason
why he is so nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Heavy steps approached the door at that moment&mdash;clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
not the pattering the boys usually
made, which was always accompanied with loud
yodels and cries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is outside?&#8221; asked Lorenz, opening
the door.</p>

<p>A well-knit man whom he knew as a fruit
merchant from Leuk stood outside. Lorenz immediately
offered him his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen you for a long time, Lesa.
How are things with you? I come with a message
from your cousin down there and he sends you
his love,&#8221; said the man heartily, shaking Lorenz
by the hand.</p>

<p>The latter was a little startled, because he felt
sure that the visit had been made on Vinzi&#8217;s behalf.
The man had often travelled over the
mountain before and had practically never come
to see him. He invited him to step inside and
make himself at home. But this could not be
done as the merchant had a wagon and two pairs
of lively horses waiting for him. He only wanted
to deliver his message from Vinzenz Lesa, who
had only heard yesterday that a team was going
across the mountain. He had, therefore, not had
time to write a letter. The farmer had been
anxious to use this good opportunity of having his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
boy brought home. All the fruit dealer added was
that he expected to return in two days, when his
business was done, and take the boy along.</p>

<p>Lorenz took the matter so much to heart that
he could say nothing. He saw that Vinzi must
leave in two days.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be here on Tuesday at eight in the morning,
Lesa,&#8221; concluded the man, casting a questioning
look at the silent farmer. &#8220;I suppose you
understand me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, only too well,&#8221; replied the other.
&#8220;The boy will be ready for you in time, you can
count on that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He followed the man to the road, where stood
a great wagon loaded with sacks and harnessed to
four strong horses. Just as the big team drove
off with loud tinkling of bells, the boys came down
singing and shouting with the cattle.</p>

<p>Lorenz walked towards them with a heavy
heart. Should he give his merry boys the unwelcome
news at once? Then all their happiness
would vanish at once. Lorenz had a soft heart
and found himself unable to do it. Greeting the
boys in a carefree manner, he let everything go its
accustomed round.</p>

<p>After supper the singing began as usual, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
they sang one song after another, as had grown to
be the custom of the house. They sang as merrily
as larks in spring, only the father could not quite
join in heartily, for a heavy load was on his heart.</p>

<p>He realized that he must tell them that evening,
as the time was already so short. Just after
the mother had said the customary words, &#8220;I suppose
we have to stop now, nine o&#8217;clock has struck,&#8221;
he made his announcement in a few clear words.
Quite thunderstruck, everyone sat silent with surprise
and sorrow. The mother was the first to regain
her speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you said that it was out of the
question and that we cannot give up the boy at
such short notice,&#8221; she said with an animation not
usual to her. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to know what he means
in coming here and trying to rob us of the boy
without the slightest ceremony, the way one might
pull off a branch from a hedge. I hope you gave
him a proper talking to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man has not come to do us harm,&#8221;
Lorenz said calmly. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t forget that
Vinzi&#8217;s parents can call him home whenever they
please. Won&#8217;t you allow them some interest in
the boy? Besides, no one can deny that the opportunity
is splendid.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>By this time the boys also had regained control
of their emotions and lost no time in giving vent
to such outcries and objections that the father
suggested they all go to bed. Often good ideas
had come over night during sleep, he said, and
these words proved to have an excellent effect.
Each boy thought that a good idea might come to
him which might prevent Vinzi&#8217;s departure. The
mother was hoping that the father would find
some obstacle to the journey, for all his best ideas
always came over night. But by saying that the
best thoughts come over night the father had
meant to say that they would in time realize that
they would have to bear the inevitable.</p>

<p>Vinzi had not said a word. When he sat on
his threshold later on, looking up at the stars, he
was conscious of a deep inner conflict. He looked
forward to seeing his mother and Stefeli again,
yes and his father, too. Maybe the latter would
be kind to him now as he used to be in the old
days Vinzi remembered so well, when he would let
the boy ride on his knees and would say to him,
&#8220;Just ride ahead, Vinzi; as soon as you can ride
you shall have a horse.&#8221; Vinzi could not quite remember
when his father had begun to treat him
less kindly. He hardly even knew the reason why.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>On the other hand was the full realization that
all his marvellous life on the mountain with these
kind people had come to an end. Yes, and the
music, all the music, too. There was no one who
would be able to help him at home, no one. Should
the whole thing really be over for good and all?
His heart contracted painfully at this thought,
but the next moment he found joy again in the
happy anticipation of going home and seeing his
loved ones.</p>

<p>Even if the music must stop when he got
home, he would not entirely lose his good teacher,
Pater Silvanus. As consolation remained the
hope that he would probably return some day, and
this thought was his last comfort before he went
to sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning there was no time for talk and
arguments, for they had to make an early start.
Jos and Faz were wandering off with the cows and
Vinzi was just following with Russli, when Uncle
Lorenz drew Vinzi to one side and said in a low
voice, &#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped Vinzi, and I am sure
you&#8217;ll be glad to go home. I specially wanted to
tell you so you can take leave of Pater Silvanus
and the grandfather. It&#8217;s your last day, for the
wagon will come for you tomorrow at eight.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>This settled it for good. Vinzi went away
silently, which was far from pleasing Russli.
&#8220;You ought to talk to me,&#8221; he said a little crossly
after they had gone quite a distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t talk well today, something seems to
choke me,&#8221; replied Vinzi. &#8220;But don&#8217;t be unhappy.
As soon as I get home I&#8217;ll send you something
for your collection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to go home at all,&#8221; Russli
said with firm conviction. &#8220;Faz has thought out
something to stop your going. He told Jos about
it at the pump. He is going on the street tomorrow
morning to wait for the wagon, and as
soon as it stops he means to climb up and say that
he is the boy from Leuk. Then the man will drive
off, and only when they come to the other side of
the mountain will Faz jump down and say that he
is not the right boy after all. Then he&#8217;ll run back.
Do you see now? The man can&#8217;t do anything then
for it will be too far for him to turn back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi was not convinced that his trip could be
prevented that way, but he felt quite touched that
Faz was so anxious to keep him. He really had
seen the least of Faz.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to send me for my collection?&#8221;
Russli inquired.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to tell you,&#8221; replied Vinzi. &#8220;If
it is a surprise, you&#8217;ll like it so much better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it something to eat?&#8221; Russli asked,
nevertheless.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and not anything to drink, either,&#8221; said
Vinzi, &#8220;but I won&#8217;t tell you anything more about
it or it won&#8217;t be a surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>After taking leave of Russli at the pasture
Vinzi went up to the convent as usual. He had
been told always to go straight to the large room
and wait for Pater Silvanus there. This was
usually only a short time, but when the Pater
entered today, Vinzi did not stand in his usual
mood of happy anticipation at the harmonium,
and his eyes did not glisten. On the contrary he
came up to the monk quite crushed, and after a
questioning look sadly informed him that this
was to be the last lesson, as he was going
home tomorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what a shame, what a shame!&#8221; said
Pater Silvanus slowly. &#8220;But won&#8217;t you be able
to keep up your music at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi fought as well as he could to keep back
the tears at this question. Despite his downcast
eyes his teacher saw that he had not been able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to restrain them as he answered, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t
think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Courage, boy,&#8221; said Pater Silvanus, kindly
patting him on the shoulder. &#8220;Keep up your
spirits! It is always lovely to go home again, and
if God finds that music is the right thing for you,
it is easy enough for Him to send someone into
your path who will help you further. Besides,
you are sure to come up to us again and as soon as
you do, we&#8217;ll take it up again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The monk had seized Vinzi&#8217;s hand in a
fatherly way and led him out. In the doorway he
gave the boy his blessing and heartily said, &#8220;God
protect you!&#8221; after which he took leave of
his pupil.</p>

<p>The boy had barely been able to mumble his
thanks, for the tears were choking him. He felt
intensely grateful that the teacher had made the
leave-taking so short, because he could not
possibly have controlled himself any longer.</p>

<p>Vinzi went toward the place where the dark
roses had bloomed. The bushes were still green,
but few roses remained.</p>

<p>He gazed about him once more. The sun had
just parted the fog, and all about him began to
gleam, the snow peaks, the mountain streams, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
walls of rock, and above all the deep blue sky. He
was glad to see it once more.</p>

<p>He next ran to the tower where the grandfather
occupied his accustomed seat in the
sunshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You come early today; that is right,&#8221; he
greeted the approaching figure. &#8220;But what is
wrong, boy? What is the matter?&#8221; he added as
soon as Vinzi stood before him. &#8220;That certainly
will make us all sad,&#8221; he replied, when Vinzi had
informed him of the reason for his early visit.
&#8220;Do you know, boy, my hope has been all along
that you would come and sing me my song in case
I should die. But I might still be here next
summer, so let us hope that you&#8217;ll be here again,
too. We&#8217;ll part with that thought now.&#8221; The
grandfather heartily shook Vinzi&#8217;s hand, as he
was unwilling to detain him longer. His relatives
probably expected him home soon, as it was his
last day with them.</p>

<p>Vinzi hurried straight home, for the grandfather
probably was right. His aunt Josepha,
who had meanwhile come to the conclusion that
Vinzi&#8217;s departure could not be prevented, rejoiced
when she saw him coming. She could now talk
quietly to him a bit. The suddenness of it all had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
destroyed her accustomed calm and she had
longed to see him.</p>

<p>Aunt Josepha and Vinzi again sat together
as on the day of his arrival. Her happy frame of
mind was fully restored when Vinzi assured her
that he had no better wish than to come back to the
mountain again another year. He hoped that
he might be one of her household again and sleep
in his lovely fragrant chamber.</p>

<p>When the family sat together in the evening,
Father Lorenz said, &#8220;Come now! Singing is the
best remedy against sad thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began a song himself. The others, joining
in, kept it up right through the evening.</p>

<p>Next day Faz&#8217;s plan did not succeed. Just as
the brothers were ready to depart and were taking
leave from Vinzi, they heard the repeated sounds
of a whip. This warned Father Lorenz that the
fruit dealer had arrived even earlier than he had
said. As he could not leave his horses, he wanted
to notify them of his coming and looking at the
road a few steps away from the house, he saw that
his signal had been understood.</p>

<p>The whole family including even the inmates
of the stable, strolled over to the street, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
fruit dealer could not help wondering at the
strange procession.</p>

<p>Vinzi climbed up to his high seat, and after he
had taken leave of each separately, the horses
started off. All five gazed after Vinzi with
genuine grief, and Russli alone felt slightly consoled
by the thought of the promised surprise.</p>

<p>When the wagon passed the spot where the
tower stood in the meadow, the whole edge of the
road was peopled with a crowd of noisy boys.
More and more seemed to gather and finally they
thundered a loud &#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; and cried &#8220;Come
again!&#8221; which was repeated a second time in such
a noisy way that the four horses actually reared.
Black Vereli had been the instigator of this, and
at the last greeting of the Tower Boys his voice
could be distinctly heard above all others.</p>

<p>At his bench alone sat the grandfather, waving
his hat high in the air, and Vinzi replied by swinging
his cap.</p>

<p>In the convent a window opened and a hand
kindly waved good-bye to Vinzi. It was that of
Pater Silvanus.</p>

<p>After a short upward stretch by wild
mountain beeches and old gnarled fir-trees the
drive quickly went downwards into the valley.</p>

<small>UNEXPECTED HAPPENINGS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">STEFELI&#8217;S summer after Vinzi&#8217;s departure
had passed much more pleasantly than
she could have forseen. This was due to
Mr. Delrick, who never started off on a long walk
without calling into the room and asking, &#8220;Can
Stefeli come with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>As the child had given up her life on the
pasture since Vinzi had gone away, the mother
always welcomed this opportunity of sending her
out. Stefeli had really been obliged to sit at home
a great deal, and the poor child could not help
fretting and sighing. Every time she heard that
question, she gladly tossed the horrid long stocking
aside and skipped out into the sunshine.
There was no end to all the things Stefeli discussed
with her companion. He was always
interested in whatever she told him about herself
and Vinzi, their life at home and on the pasture.
He heard about the music lessons and the
strange consequences they had brought, also
how the members of the household differed on
certain subjects.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>In this way Mr. Delrick acquired a minute
knowledge of the happenings in the Lesa household.
But he became intimate with the three
members of the family in other ways besides.
Vinzenz Lesa liked to spend his free evenings on
the bench before his house. Here the walnut tree
wafted to him the perfume of its fragrant leaves.
When he smoked his pipe, he was always glad if
Mr. Delrick came to talk to him, for the farmer
loved to discuss the affairs of the world. Mr.
Delrick who had a wide knowledge, could explain
many things that were not quite clear to him and
also showed a lively interest in everything connected
with agriculture. They discussed the
problems of the farm together, and even when
Mr. Lesa was the instructor, Mr. Delrick&#8217;s suggestions
proved very useful. Many changes
and improvements were made on the place
in consequence.</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick&#8217;s conversation with Mrs. Lesa
was very different. It always drifted to the same
subject, even if they had begun to talk of something
else. This absorbing subject was Vinzi.
The mother had told Mr. Delrick of Vinzi&#8217;s intense
love of music from the time he had been a
little lad, and how the father&#8217;s whole ambition was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
centered on bringing him up as a successful
farmer. The father&#8217;s pride and joy consisted in
the work he was doing and he naturally expected
the boy to look after the property some day.
This conflict filled her with deep anxiety. She
saw no way out of the difficult situation and was
constantly anticipating some great sorrow as the
final outcome.</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick was filled with sympathetic interest
and tried to allay her anxiety. He comforted
her by saying that young boys often put
aside such fancies, especially when a smiling
future lay before them, as was the case with Vinzi.
Her troublesome thoughts kept on recurring
nevertheless, and it was hard for the mother to
anticipate the future calmly. His sympathetic
words seemed to ease her heart, however, and
therefore he regularly led back to their usual subject
of conversation.</p>

<p>In this way Mr. Delrick had succeeded in becoming
the special friend and confidant of every
member of the little household. Whenever a
question came up which was hard to solve, Stefeli,
as well as her father and mother, said right away,
&#8220;We must ask Mr. Delrick, he&#8217;ll know,&#8221; or when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
something was worrying them, &#8220;If we ask Mr.
Delrick, he&#8217;ll tell us what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the good news was brought from the
mountain that Vinzi was loved there by old and
young and had grown so merry that everybody
else had grown still more so, Mr. Delrick took as
lively an interest in the news as if he were a member
of the family, too. The mother remained
rather quiet, but he as well as the father could not
help hoping that the lad had at last found satisfaction
in his work. He looked forward, therefore,
to the happy reunion of the little family in
which he had grown so intimate before he
left them.</p>

<p>The day came when father Lesa had given his
wife, in the presence of Mr. Delrick, the news
of Vinzi&#8217;s homecoming in five days. Meeting an
old acquaintance who was driving across the
mountain, he had made use of the opportunity to
ask him to bring his boy home. This the man had
promised to do.</p>

<p>The mother&#8217;s heart beat with joyous anticipation,
and Stefeli in her excitement could not sit
still any longer but flew restlessly here and there
in the most aimless fashion. She felt as if she
could not possibly live through those days. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
constantly counted the hours; if a day had twenty-four
hours, five days had five times as many. Oh,
that made a dreadful lot of hours. But she had
reckoned the hours when she was asleep and
luckily one did not feel those. So the counting
had to begin anew. Strangely enough the fifth
day had come at last and much sooner than she
had dared to hope.</p>

<p>Stefeli had returned from a stroll with Mr.
Delrick just as her father had come in from the
field. &#8220;Vinzi may come any moment now,&#8221; he
said to the mother. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have supper so he can
sit right down with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick was called and they began to
eat. Stefeli could scarcely swallow from nervousness,
and the mother, too, could not disguise
her agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here he comes!&#8221; suddenly cried the child,
as she bounded away.</p>

<p>None of the others had heard anything, but a
few moments later Stefeli entered the room,
triumphantly holding Vinzi&#8217;s hand. The joy of
the parents at their son&#8217;s return was not noisy,
but it could not be doubted. Vinzenz Lesa&#8217;s look
betokened real pride when he led the boy up to
Mr. Delrick.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>The latter gazed at him keenly, for his
thoughts had long been busy with him. He did
not need to wonder when he saw the splendid lad
who had so completely won his mother&#8217;s heart and
upon whom his father had built his hopes.</p>

<p>Everybody sat down, and Vinzi was asked to
tell about his relatives. He grew constantly more
lively and could not say enough of their kindness
to him. When the father wished to know how
the pasture up there had pleased him, Vinzi in
blissful remembrance described the mountain-pasture
to them. The violets up there filled the
air with fragrance and the high larches spread
their wide branches over the moss-covered stones.
The cows grazed quietly between the trees so that
their bells resounded far and wide like a song
of peace.</p>

<p>The mother asked if beautiful flowers grew on
the pasture. Here Vinzi grew still more enthusiastic
and told them about the red field of roses
which gleamed in the sunshine and from below
made the whole mountain look like fire. Vinzi
also spoke of his sleeping room and how he had
loved to have his own little house which was filled
with the delicious fragrance of hay.</p>

<p>Father and mother looked quite amazed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
their son. Never before had he spoken with such
surety and animation, and both had the same impression.
They said to themselves that Vinzi was
not the boy who had left them. The father added
to himself, &#8220;He has matured up there. That is
good, for he&#8217;ll know now what he wants.&#8221; And
the mother thought, &#8220;New life has sprung up
within him. I wonder what will be the outcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next morning Stefeli was on her feet especially
early, for the joy of having Vinzi with her
again had not let her sleep any longer. She had
wanted to knock on his door in order to keep him
from oversleeping. Now everything would have
to go back to the old order and they would be able
to go together to the pasture as of yore, something
she had a tremendous longing for.</p>

<p>Just as she put her finger to the door, Vinzi
opened it and came out completely dressed.</p>

<p>Stefeli drew back amazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you get up dreadfully early!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;You never used to do that, Vinzi;
that&#8217;s why I wanted to call you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you see that I can do it, too,&#8221; Vinzi
said, laughing at her surprise. &#8220;On the mountain
I always got up early. When one impatiently
looks forward to something pleasant, sleep goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
off easily. One can jump out of bed then. You
see I have still the habit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it that made you so happy?
What did you look forward to every day?&#8221;
asked Stefeli surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; said Vinzi, going
downstairs.</p>

<p>Under the open door stood the father taking a
look at the weather. He too, had only just come
out of his bedroom. He turned around.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, you up already?&#8221; he said, astonished.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a good sign. You learned something
worth while up there, Vinzi, for you did not use
to be the first in the morning. Come and walk
over to our walnut trees till your mother calls us
to breakfast. Don&#8217;t you think our trees are fine,
and the grass about them, too? I hope you have
learned to see that it is not quite so bad here at
home. It is beautiful here, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; assented Vinzi from the bottom of
his heart, looking up to the rich foliage of the
walnut trees under whose shade he had spent so
many happy hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you found out up there how fine
the life of a farmer really is. If you have done so,
you&#8217;ll realize now how beautiful our place is. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
could not possibly have a better prospect than to
own and cultivate such a fine farm. Don&#8217;t you
agree with me that it is the best anybody could
hope for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know something I&#8217;d like much better,&#8221; replied
Vinzi with hesitation. Then he was silent.</p>

<p>In surprise the farmer gazed at his son.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me, Vinzi. I don&#8217;t mind if you
enjoyed the mountain so much, and I won&#8217;t say a
word against it. Only I don&#8217;t understand what
you should have found up there better than we
have. What is it? Tell me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the most beautiful thing I know is Pater
Silvanus&#8217; harmonium in the hospice. My dearest
wish would be to learn to play it as well as he
does,&#8221; answered Vinzi.</p>

<p>Vinzenz Lesa directed a searching glance at
his son. After a pause he said, &#8220;Do you mean
that seriously, Vinzi, or is it meant to be a joke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I mean it,&#8221; answered Vinzi.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said the father abruptly. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ll
tell you something, too, for you ought to know
what I think. I sent you away because I wanted
you to learn all about farming in company with
those jolly boys. You simply have to learn to
enjoy it sooner or later. I thought that your eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
had been opened and you had matured and come
back more sensible. Now I find you just as
childish as when you started, with nothing in your
head but nonsense and foolish music. But I&#8217;ll
find other ways and means to teach you sense.
After all there must be some way for a person to
see how lucky he is. I should never have thought
that you could have started such rubbish up there,
too. Well, that settles it! You shall never go
back! I&#8217;ll still find a way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi had listened calmly to everything the
father had said. But the last words seemed to
crush him like a thunderbolt. The moment his
father turned and went towards the house, he
threw himself on the ground. By pressing his
face into the grass he tried to stifle his violent sobs.
He had secretly feared that his father would not
want to hear anything about his longing to study
music, and he had not dared to have any hope in
that respect. All his finest anticipations, however,
had been built upon returning to the
mountain. Everything was now at an end and
the terrible words, &#8220;You shall never go back,&#8221;
resounded over and over again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vinzi, you are to&#8221;&mdash;cried Stefeli now, but
she stopped suddenly and ran over to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
&#8220;What is it, Vinzi?&#8221; she asked, terribly
frightened on hearing his sobs and groans.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_208fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;WHAT IS IT, VINZI?&#8221; SHE ASKED, TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED ON HEARING
HIS SOBS AND GROANS</p>

<p>But the boy could give her no reply.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am sure you have to come,&#8221; Stefeli said
timidly, &#8220;If you could only stop, Vinzi. You
must come to breakfast, for father is already
sitting down and mother sent me for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi jumped up and ran to the pump. By
washing his eyes over and over again he hoped to
remove the traces of his tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter, just come now,&#8221; Stefeli
urged. &#8220;Mr. Delrick never comes down to
breakfast, father doesn&#8217;t pay attention, and
mother won&#8217;t say anything. Please come now.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the two entered, the father threw a sharp
glance at Vinzi, who took his seat with a drooping
head. Vinzenz Lesa pushed his half-emptied cup
from him and, rising, went quickly out.</p>

<p>He could not stand the sight of tears, least of
all from his boy, who was more precious to him
than his estate. The mother gazed after
him surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter with father? He didn&#8217;t
even empty his cup,&#8221; she said, glancing at Vinzi,
who just then raised his eyes. &#8220;But for heaven&#8217;s
sake, Vinzi, what is wrong with you?&#8221; she cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
much more concerned still. &#8220;Your eyes are
swollen and red. What has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi wanted to say something but could not
utter a sound. Laying his head upon his arm, he
burst out crying.</p>

<p>The mother&#8217;s face expressed the greatest
anxiety as she looked at him. Stefeli quickly
swallowed her milk, then ran outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only Mr. Delrick would come,&#8221; she
sighed. Stefeli had noticed that whenever her
parents sought his advice, affairs were usually
straightened out, so she was most anxious to find
him now.</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick had just left his room and was
that moment coming downstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready to start?&#8221; he asked kindly, when
Stefeli bounded to him and gave him her hand.
&#8220;Will you take a morning walk with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stefeli had hoped for this and willingly
started on her way with her desired companion.
He soon heard what lay heavily on her heart; how
Vinzi had red and swollen eyes from crying and
the father had pushed away his cup of coffee
before finishing it and had quickly gone out; also
how terribly sad the mother looked, more sad than
she had ever seen her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>&#8220;But I am sure you can help us,&#8221; Stefeli concluded
with firm conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do what I can,&#8221; Mr. Delrick promised,
smilingly.</p>

<p>But the child&#8217;s words had made him very
thoughtful; he seriously wondered if the mother&#8217;s
sad supposition would be realized now. The
thought worried him the more, as he had fixed
upon his departure within the next few days, having
planned to meet a friend at the Italian lakes.</p>

<p>When the two returned from their walk,
matters had not improved. Vinzi had finally told
his mother the words that had crushed him so
completely. He thought that everything now was
over, but his mother comforted him by saying that
the father&#8217;s words were probably not final. If
only Vinzi tried hard to stick to his work and did
everything to please his father, showing in that
way that he really cared for what he wanted of
him, the time would surely come when he would
be allowed to go back to his friends.</p>

<p>But Vinzi shook his head. &#8220;Father won&#8217;t ever
let me go back there, for he said that I was finding
pleasure in something he does not want me to do.
And it&#8217;s true. I understand now what he means,
and I never quite knew before.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>To this the mother said nothing, for she could
not help feeling that Vinzi was right. Would the
boy be sent away again, and where? Her husband
had another relative, an older brother, with whom
he used to manage their property in Freiburg, till
their old cousin in Leuk had died. Her husband
had taken charge of it, as they had inherited it
together. He had felt that, as the beautiful place
was so badly run down, it was better to look after
it himself for a number of years, if he wanted to
bring it up again. Her husband&#8217;s brother was as
silent and unsociable as the old cousin who used to
live here had been, and he also looked quite as unkempt.
Vinzenz Lesa had left a hired man on the
farm, who looked after things. His brother never
wanted to undertake anything new and only
hoped that Vinzenz Lesa would soon return.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa knew that there had been rather
odd members in the Lesa family from time to
time and suddenly a new anxiety rose in her heart.
If the father should really decide to send Vinzi
to his father&#8217;s old farm in order to teach him
interest in farm work, he naturally would find no
other distractions there. Mightn&#8217;t the boy, who
had always been different from other children,
become more peculiar? He might in the exclusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
company of his uncle get rather odd in his ways.
People had told her that the old man who used to
live in Leuk would sit by the hour before his barn
staring straight in front of him. People used to
call him Starri from Leuk.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> Their brother in
Freiburg was supposed to do the same. Such
names easily become current, and as every one
knew where the Lesa family originally came
from, he, too, was called by the people the Starri
of Leuk.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Lesa&#8217;s thoughts had travelled
thus far, she felt still more worried. The father&#8217;s
chief cause of complaint against the boy was that
he always stared into the distance, not seeing and
hearing what went on before his eyes. Would it
be possible that her lively, splendid Vinzi should
turn into the third Starri of Leuk?</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa was suddenly roused from her disturbing
thoughts by Stefeli&#8217;s entrance. The child
told her that Mr. Delrick had already come back
from his walk and was sitting in Vinzi&#8217;s room
talking to the boy. Quickly she set about preparing
his breakfast for as he had come back so
much earlier than usual, she was not yet ready
for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>Mr. Delrick knew about Vinzi&#8217;s keen passion
for music as well as the father&#8217;s wishes and desires
for his son&#8217;s future, with the original cause of
Vinzi&#8217;s stay on the mountain. But he had not
understood from Stefeli&#8217;s words what had
brought on Vinzi&#8217;s tears and the father&#8217;s anger so
soon after the boy&#8217;s happy return. As he took
the greatest interest in the weal and woe of the
Lesa family, he wished to know if he could not
help them somehow. His stay in the house was
to be of very short duration, that was why he had
come back so soon from his stroll. He had gone
to the darkly brooding Vinzi and informed him
that he was planning to go to the Italian lakes and
in two days would travel across the Simplon. If
Vinzi had any messages for friends there, he
would be glad to deliver them, as he expected to
spend the night there.</p>

<p>For a moment a ray of sunshine flitted over
Vinzi&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you also going to see Pater Silvanus
and the grandfather?&#8221; he asked, with burning
eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who they are,&#8221; replied Mr.
Delrick. &#8220;But tell me about all your friends
there and what happened to you on the mountain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Then you can tell me what messages I am to take
to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>To be able to speak about things which were
in his inmost thoughts poured balm on Vinzi&#8217;s
aching heart. Mr. Delrick&#8217;s deep sympathy and
understanding of his joy in his music studies with
Pater Silvanus made it possible for him to tell
about everything that had made him so happy on
the mountain. He was willing enough to do
whatever work he was set to do, Vinzi concluded,
but the idea of never playing any more or hearing
more music was too dreadful. He had till now
always had the hope that he could spend next
summer on the mountain and could then continue
his lessons with Pater Silvanus, but today his
father had definitely told him that he was never
to go back.</p>

<p>The matter began to grow clearer to Mr.
Delrick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Vinzi,&#8221; he said, after a pause, &#8220;did
the Pater urge you to keep up your music at home
or did he only mean to take it up again when you
went back to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi reported the Pater&#8217;s injunction, also his
own reply, telling how impossible this was on account
of his father&#8217;s objection to it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>&#8220;Would you like to learn an instrument in
order to give yourself pleasure by playing,
Vinzi?&#8221; said Mr. Delrick. &#8220;Did you ever think
of making music your whole and only life&#8217;s work?
I suppose you could not even imagine that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi&#8217;s eyes flamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I could, and I thought about it long
ago, when I was on the mountain. I could
imagine well how it would be,&#8221; Vinzi assured him.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t only want to study an instrument, but
to learn everything about music. Pater Silvanus
knows everything and can explain how to put the
tones together in order to make harmonious
music. Also how to write down melodies one has
in one&#8217;s head so people can read it again from a
sheet. He had already begun to explain it all
and teach me how to do it. It was so wonderful!
I wouldn&#8217;t mind shoveling snow all day and working
hard the way they have to do up there in
winter, if only I could spend the evenings with
Pater Silvanus, for he said he would keep on
teaching me. Now I&#8217;ll never be allowed to go up
the mountain any more, never!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was hard for Vinzi to suppress his newly
rising grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Vinzi,&#8221; Mr. Delrick said kindly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
&#8220;your father wants you to be happy. You know
that yourself and I can absolutely assure you of
it. He said the words you worry about so much
because he thinks that your life on the mountain
might interfere with your future happiness.
Time may bring many changes, and therefore it
is possible that he won&#8217;t have to keep his word.
It is entirely wrong, though, for you to keep on
repeating these words to yourself, for they only
make you sad and take all your spirit away. Did
you not find joy and happiness where you expected
unhappiness? Remember that, Vinzi, and
keep up your courage.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother had entered meanwhile and after
setting the breakfast on the table had immediately
vanished. It had calmed her to hear how
Mr. Delrick was speaking to her boy and how
attentively the latter was listening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Vinzi,&#8221; said Mr. Delrick rising, &#8220;pull
yourself together and be glad that you are home
again. Show your father a pleasant face when he
comes home, and if you are willing to do what he
tells you to, everything may still come right.
Will you promise me to think about what I have
just now said?&#8221;</p>

<p>This Vinzi gladly did, and when the mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
entered a little later after Mr. Delrick had gone
out, his eyes already were somewhat clearer.</p>

<p>The day went quietly by. All the inmates of
the house, feeling that the happiness of the evening
before had vanished, could not help being depressed.
When the day was over and Vinzenz
Lesa had settled as usual on his bench, his forehead
lay in deep furrows. Staring at the
ground, he even let his pipe go out.</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick now stepped up to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lesa,&#8221; he said, striking a match and
offering the light to his host, &#8220;you are not in a
good humor, or you would not let your pipe go
out. Here, light it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humor, you say, humor!&#8221; Lesa repeated
grimly. &#8220;If one&#8217;s field is spoilt by hail, one can
always hope that it will bring good fruit next
year. But when a man&#8217;s only son goes from bad
to worse, no hope is left him. From worse he can
only go to worst, and then I suppose he can&#8217;t go
any further.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as I can judge you have a very upright,
well-mannered son,&#8221; said Mr. Delrick
deliberately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he is. I don&#8217;t complain of that,&#8221; retorted
Lesa. &#8220;It&#8217;s something else. What help is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
there when everything has been done to make him
happy and he does not see it or know what is best
for him. He only hankers after childish rubbish!
I won&#8217;t give in till he comes to reason, even if I
should have to send him across the ocean. I know
of a place, though, which is quite near, where
he couldn&#8217;t find any chance to keep up his
foolish fancies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you mean by that your son&#8217;s
passion for music and his desire to devote himself
to it. There might be more in it than foolish
fancies, though; it might be very serious on his
part,&#8221; said Mr. Delrick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something serious in it!&#8221; replied the father
in agitation. &#8220;It is just play, like any other. I
have nothing against it, if young boys sing jolly
songs in the evenings. But that is not the way he
does. He sits and stares and neither sees nor
hears anything, but thinks about his foolish piping.
Once I found a whole heap of pipes he had
carved. How could that be other than childish
rubbish? And the idea of putting your thoughts
on such a thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That shows that there is something serious
in it,&#8221; answered Mr. Delrick. &#8220;If it were only
play like any other, he would have exchanged it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
for something else long ago, the way boys are apt
to do. His whole thinking and wishing then
would not always go to the same object. His
persistence in trying to make a better instrument
for himself, shows how great his zeal for the
matter really is. I am perfectly convinced that
it is not play, but serious work with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Work! the idea of calling that work!&#8221;</p>

<p>To express his indignation, Vinzenz Lesa
blew unusually thick clouds of smoke from
his pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Music certainly can be work, and where
there is real talent, it can be a splendid career,&#8221;
Mr. Delrick continued. &#8220;I think you ought to
let your son learn an instrument. His longing
for it is so great that he would gladly do the
heaviest work to have this wish gratified.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzenz Lesa put by his pipe, which was a
sure sign of intense excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; he said with suppressed anger,
&#8220;Vinzenz Lesa&#8217;s only son shall not be a musician.
He has an estate on which he can live like a
gentleman. If he wants to blow a trumpet later
on, he can well afford to. But it is quite another
matter to take a boy away from a healthy, sound
work and bring him up to playing instruments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and making music. He has no sense yet and
would probably come to me and say what
you have just told me, that he wants to make
music his career. No sir, Vinzenz Lesa&#8217;s son is
not going to be a travelling musician.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All musicians do not necessarily have to be
vagabonds,&#8221; was Mr. Delrick&#8217;s quick reply.
&#8220;There are many musicians with glorious gifts
who do their work quite differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and they all come to one&#8217;s house,&#8221;
continued the excited father, &#8220;many hundreds of
them. They all make music. The father plays
on a broken fiddle and a woman in rags sings
with a shrill voice. That&#8217;s the end of all of them!
If you had an only son, sir, would you let him
become such a one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely not one like that,&#8221; replied Mr.
Delrick. &#8220;But if I should happen to have a
son with great gifts as a composer, nothing would
prevent me from furthering his wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy has not got great gifts,&#8221; said the
father obstinately, &#8220;because such great gifts
don&#8217;t happen often. Will you believe me when
I say that as soon as Vinzi comes to reason, he&#8217;ll
be glad and grateful that he can live on a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
farm and doesn&#8217;t have to wander about the
world as a musician?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick had to admit to himself that he
really did not know how much talent Vinzi had.
All he knew was the boy&#8217;s great longing. He
also felt that Mr. Lesa&#8217;s opinion about a
musician&#8217;s miserable life could not possibly be
changed. He had puzzled how he could be
certain on that point. How otherwise would he
have the right to fight the father&#8217;s great disinclination?
Maybe he should rather support
the father&#8217;s opinion and help to bring his son to
the right path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lesa,&#8221; he said, rising and giving his
hand to his host, &#8220;don&#8217;t let us talk about it any
more today, for we don&#8217;t seem to come to an
understanding, but I mean to take it up again
and I hope we shall fully agree with each other
then. We have always gotten along so well
till now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So we have,&#8221; replied Vinzenz Lesa, shaking
the proffered hand. &#8220;Whenever we don&#8217;t agree,
I always know that you mean well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick now made ready to go. On the
next day, the last before his departure, the whole
house was as still and quiet as if a misfortune
were impending. To the unhappy thoughts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the inmates was added the grief that the friend
who had always been their comfort was to leave
them. Stefeli had expected everything to be joyful
again as soon as Vinzi returned. Just the
opposite had happened, and now the only one who
could have helped them was going away.</p>

<p>On the last evening Mr. Delrick told the
mother of his conversation with Mr. Lesa and
comforted her by the assurance that he had not
given up the hope of finding a way out for Vinzi.
But she had given up and saw only grief ahead
for them all. Even if her husband would give
way to the persuasions of Mr. Delrick, he would
never be reconciled to the matter and a breach
would remain between them. Only one person
could have prevented that, and he was the one
who had to go.</p>

<p>Vinzi felt that if he could talk sometimes
with Mr. Delrick he might regain his joy and
confidence. His heart was therefore very heavy
at his friend&#8217;s departure. Mr. Lesa had the full
conviction that his wife and son did not understand
what was necessary for Vinzi&#8217;s good. The
only person who would probably comprehend it
at last and would then bring the others round
was departing. Mr. Delrick in spite of speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
a kindly word to one and an encouraging one to
the other was unable to lift their spirits.</p>

<p>In the evening when he had withdrawn to
his room, some one knocked on his door and
Vinzi entered, carrying two little books and a
small package. He asked timidly if Mr. Delrick
would take these things to his three cousins. The
package he had promised to send to Russli before
he left. The books were for Jos and Faz,
for the boys had told him that they liked to read
on winter evenings. As they possessed so few
books, they were obliged to read the same ones
over and over again. Vinzi also wished to send
his best love to everybody in his uncle&#8217;s house, as
well as to the grandfather and Pater Silvanus.
He was anxious to thank them all and let them
know how happy he had been with them and how
much he wanted ... but here Vinzi could
speak no further. Quickly saying good-night
he went out.</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick had planned to go back from the
Italian lakes to Germany by another route. He
hoped to return next summer, at which the whole
family rejoiced. Stefeli, however, thought that
this was too far off. Early next morning he
drove away in the direction of the Simplon.</p>

<small>SURPRISES, BUT NOT ONLY FOR
RUSSLI</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">DURING the months of September and
October Vinzenz Lesa was always very
busy. He usually went about in excellent
spirits, as he had good reason to rejoice over the
blessings of his harvest. But this fall he was
often silent and could be seen standing still,
staring in front of him absent-mindedly. Apparently
his thoughts were busy with something
which worried him. His son&#8217;s future occupied
him day and night and left him no peace, for he
loved Vinzi dearly and was as proud of him as
only a father can be. Every one was fond of
Vinzi, but he wished him to realize his fortunate
prospects. Thousands would envy him the
smooth, carefree life which lay before him. All
he needed was to have his eyes opened.</p>

<p>Vinzenz Lesa, after pondering deeply for a
long, long while finally reached a conclusion.
One day he entered the living room and found his
wife busy mending his old coat. Needless to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
her thoughts were also busied with the same
problem constantly occupying them both.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to take the boy away on
Sunday,&#8221; he said upon entering. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take him
to my brother in Freiburg, who will be only too
glad to get Vinzi. There is always lots of work
till winter time. Vinzi can&#8217;t count on many distractions
there, so it will be good for him if he has
plenty to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa&#8217;s work slipped out of her hands.
Pale with dread, she gazed at her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you thought about the condition your
brother is in, Vinzenz? Do you remember what
name they call him by?&#8221; she asked, dreadfully
frightened. In her mind&#8217;s eye she saw Vinzi
before her, staring in front of him as he was wont
to do, and her brother-in-law&#8217;s pathetic figure
right beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That does not matter,&#8221; answered her
husband. &#8220;My brother is not vicious he only
hates giving orders. He does not like to work,
but his mind is quite clear enough to know that
the place needs a master besides a servant. That
is why he wants me to come back or send him my
boy. Vinzi is not stupid. As soon as he sees
that he can give orders, he&#8217;ll get a liking for it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
which is the first step to knowledge. It is the
best way out for him, believe me! I have thought
it out and I mean to go on Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa wished to raise other objections,
but everything she said seemed only to confirm
her husband&#8217;s statement that he had found the
right place for Vinzi, so she remained silent.
When her husband had gone and she was left
alone with her own thoughts, she remembered
her great grief when Vinzi had been sent away
before. How differently things had gone with
him from what she had feared. She had really
been ungrateful to God, for he had brought her
lad to kindly people. Why should she begin to
worry and doubt again, as if she knew better
what was good for Vinzi? She would put everything
into His hands, with the confidence that
the good Father in Heaven meant well with all
His children and would lead hers also to final
happiness. This thought calmed her. She decided
to talk it all over with Vinzi, who as yet
knew nothing of his near departure. She found
it better to prepare him by telling him about the
farm of his ancestors. Then he would understand
that he was sent away because some one
was needed on the place.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>That evening, when she heard Vinzi coming
home, she called him in. He had been out in
the woods all day with his father. As the father
had work to do in the barn and stable, he would
not miss the boy. Stefeli, who ran in at once,
was sent off on an errand to the barn in the hope
that she would probably remain a considerable
time with her old friends in the stable.</p>

<p>But Stefeli had noticed that the mother had
something special in mind regarding Vinzi and
as she wanted to hear it all, she returned in a
twinkling. The mother, however, was not
desirous of her presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go over to the barnyard,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
look for eggs in every nook and corner. You
know that the chickens lay them sometimes
where one least suspects them. Bring them here
afterwards, but be sure to look everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stefeli ran as fast as she could go, but she had
barely left the house, when she came running
back. Flinging open the door, she cried, &#8220;He
is coming back! He is coming back!&#8221;</p>

<p>The next moment she was gone again. The
mother and Vinzi looked at each other. The
same thought had flashed through their heads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
but it seemed so impossible that they did not
dare to mention it.</p>

<p>The door opened again, and what they had
thought impossible really had come to pass.
Stefeli triumphantly entered at the side of Mr.
Delrick, whose hand she was holding. The
surprise was so great for Vinzi and Mrs. Lesa
that neither could say a word, but pure joy
gleamed from their faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;I changed my plans,&#8221; said Mr. Delrick
after the first greetings. &#8220;My friends are returning
to Germany another way, and therefore
I had to come back once more. Your relatives
up there loaded me with greetings for Vinzi and
I am glad to bring them to him myself. If I
had gone to Germany another way I could not
have done so, and the good people insisted on my
delivering them. They treated me as an old
friend because I brought them Vinzi&#8217;s greetings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi&#8217;s eyes gleamed with pleasure and the
bliss of remembrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see them all? The grandfather
and Pater Silvanus, too?&#8221; he asked expectantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, everybody, and they all seem to love
you, Vinzi,&#8221; replied Mr. Delrick. &#8220;Your good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
uncle Lorenz and his wife could not tell me
enough about your happy times together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick also described how pleased the
three boys had been with their gifts. They sent
their warmest thanks. Russli did not let his
present leave his hands, wherever he walked or
stood, he held on to the red silk bag, filled with
fine agate marbles. He had sent a special
message for Vinzi, which Mr. Delrick had not
quite understood, but hoped Vinzi could make
out. Russli wanted Vinzi to know that he would
never in his life tickle them any more. He had
never thought a surprise could be so lovely.</p>

<p>At that moment the father entered. In surprise
over his guest he stood stock-still for a moment.
Mr. Delrick had risen to greet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am glad it&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Lesa with
joyful eyes, shaking the proffered hand heartily.
&#8220;I always thought this would happen somehow.
It has been so empty here since you left. Welcome
again to our house!&#8221; he added, strengthening
this sentiment with a renewed shaking of the
hand. &#8220;Let us sit down to supper now; my wife
is sure to have something special for you. She
couldn&#8217;t be less happy than I am at your coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa had already disappeared to prepare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
supper. The meal passed most pleasantly,
as the joy of seeing Mr. Delrick again had driven
away all gloomy thoughts.</p>

<p>When every one rose from the table, Mr.
Delrick said, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to have a little talk with
you, out on the bench, the way we used to do;
but don&#8217;t forget your pipe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; replied Vinzenz Lesa.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa understood that Mr. Delrick
desired to speak to her husband alone, so she kept
the children with her indoors.</p>

<p>As soon as the men were seated on the bench,
Mr. Delrick began: &#8220;I suppose, Mr. Lesa, you
have guessed that I had a reason for coming back
and changing my plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do nothing without a good reason,&#8221; replied
the other thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must tell you something which is so important
that I wanted to lose no time,&#8221; continued
Mr. Delrick. &#8220;I had planned to spend a day on
the mountain to give Vinzi&#8217;s messages in person
and to look up his friends there. First, I called
on your worthy cousin, Mr. Lorenz Lesa and his
wife. These good people could not speak enough
about Vinzi. They miss him so much, for he
made life exceedingly pleasant for old and young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
with his songs and music. I suppose a father
likes to hear that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The latter nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I visited the old grandfather in the
tower, who was greatly touched by Vinzi&#8217;s
message. He said that Vinzi had given him the
most beautiful hours he had had for years&mdash;the
times your boy had trained the chorus to sing to
the old man. It is the grandfather&#8217;s dearest wish
to have the boy play for him when he is taking
his last journey. I think that this must have
been more than a light little song, for it could
not otherwise have made such a deep impression
on the grandfather. What do you think
Mr. Lesa?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzenz Lesa silently nodded again.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I asked the grandfather if Pater
Silvanus knew anything about music, he grew
quite talkative. He told me that Pater Silvanus
had been a very fine musician and had spent
many years in a college in Rome. He had sought
out the solitude on the mountain voluntarily and
had lived there many years, doing good. I found
him just the man I was looking for,&#8221; Mr. Delrick
went on, &#8220;a man who could give me an opinion
on Vinzi&#8217;s talent. So of course I went to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
monk. As soon as he heard that I came from
Vinzi, he was very friendly and immediately
asked me what the boy was doing with his music.
Then I told him that I had come especially to
find out what he thought of Vinzi&#8217;s gift. The
good monk grew enthusiastic. &#8216;You ask me if
he has talent,&#8217; he exclaimed. &#8216;The boy is simply
full of music. When I studied with him I never
had the feeling of teaching him anything. It was
more like drawing everything out of him.&#8217; In
order that I could judge he told me that the first
melody Vinzi had composed and had worked out
by himself was so original and lovely that he himself
often played it. Vinzi had also composed a
tune to some words, and this had simply won
every one&#8217;s heart. The cow-herds on the pastures
as well as the girls at their spinning-wheels would
often sing it. The young lads whistled it in the
barns and stables, and people all about hummed
it and called it &#8216;Our song.&#8217; No one quite remembered
where it had come from, and it had
grown to be the favorite property of the whole
mountain-side. I don&#8217;t doubt the boy&#8217;s talent
any longer, Mr. Lesa, and I hope you also are
convinced that it is worth while to open the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
for such a gift and develop it. I am sure you
mean to do so, Mr. Lesa.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a while the farmer deeply pondered,
blowing clouds of smoke into the air. Then he
said thoughtfully: &#8220;And what then? To develop
it will mean to teach the boy to make music till
he won&#8217;t want to do anything else. But Vinzenz
Lesa wants no musician for a son. They are a
shiftless crowd, and Vinzi has a good home. If
he once begins to wander about, he won&#8217;t ever
be able to settle down and that will be his ruin.
How can you expect me, who realizes all this, to
start him on it? No, sir, you can&#8217;t expect this!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this unexpected reply Mr. Delrick remained
silent. A considerable time passed till
he said calmly after ripe consideration. &#8220;Apparently
I can&#8217;t get you beyond the idea of his
becoming a travelling musician. But let me make
you a proposition. I hope you still have some
confidence in me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; the other replied firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Then I&#8217;ll propose that you should
let me have your boy for a year or longer. I&#8217;ll
do for him what I would do for my own son. If
he comes back and you still think as you do today,
a year among strangers will not have harmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
him. If he is to spend the rest of his life here on
the farm, it won&#8217;t be bad if he has learned something.
That never has hurt anybody yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lesa, after considering, suddenly came to a
determination. &#8220;That can&#8217;t be, sir,&#8221; he said
decisively.</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick asked the reason for this sudden
statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t possibly send my son into your house
for a whole year when you have paid me more for
just a few weeks than was necessary,&#8221; Vinzenz
Lesa explained.</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick smiled. &#8220;I live alone in a large
old house, which is very still and empty. Having
the boy with me will make a most welcome
change, as you can see for yourself. He will
bring new life into my existence. But if you are
not yet satisfied, I promise to come to you as
guest as often as I want to and till we are absolutely
even. You know how much I like it here.
Please let us settle it, Mr. Lesa. I can only hope
you will never regret it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzenz Lesa could not help thinking to himself
that a year among strangers would benefit
Vinzi greatly. After all, the boy had seen very
little of other people&#8217;s lives. He would meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
boys of his own age struggling for their existence
and that might teach him to be grateful for his
own good fortune. To be taken to the paved
streets of a city from his free life in the country
might even make him homesick and anxious to
come back before the year was out. The father
would not ask for more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll agree,&#8221; said Vinzenz Lesa firmly, pressing
the proffered hand to conclude the bargain.
&#8220;I only want to say one more word. If Vinzi
should wish to come home sooner than we have
settled, you must let him come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick willingly promised. Then he
rose in order to communicate the husband&#8217;s new
plan to the anxious mother, while his companion
took his accustomed evening trip through the
barn and stable. Mrs. Lesa could find no words
to express her gratitude and joy over this new
turn events had taken. Now Vinzi was saved
from staying with his dreadful uncle, and how
wonderful was the way by which he had been
spared! Even if she did not quite know what
Mr. Delrick meant to do with Vinzi, she was
overjoyed at the prospect that her boy was to
spend a whole year with such a man. Vinzi likewise
knew no more about his immediate future,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
but looked forward to everything with joyful
confidence. Mr. Delrick had told him that Pater
Silvanus&#8217; wishes in regard to him were to be
carried out. This meant that he was going to
be happy.</p>

<p>Three days later came another day of parting.
No one was sad this time, because each had some
consolation. Only Stefeli rebelled a little, for
it seemed to the poor child that no one on earth
was compelled to be as lonely as she was.</p>

<p>In the winter which followed, Stefeli had to
take many a solitary walk. She had no companion
on her way to school and got very weary
going alone twice daily to and fro. As she was
of a most sociable disposition, this occasioned her
many a bitter sigh.</p>

<p>From time to time Mr. Delrick sent news
about Vinzi. Mrs. Lesa read the letters aloud to
her husband and the reports were always good.
Vinzi was well and busy with his studies. The
boy sent hearty greetings to his family, and the
missive always concluded with kind words from
Mr. Delrick. He spoke of his great joy in
having the boy with him and watching his
rapid development.</p>

<p>When the father had breathlessly listened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
these reports about his son&#8217;s welfare, he often
showed some disappointment. He always seemed
to be waiting for some message which did not
come. &#8220;Is that all?&#8221; he would ask when his wife
had finished.</p>

<p>After she had assured him that she had read
every word he silently went away. His wife had
guessed long ago that he waited for something
which did not happen. She felt that he would
have been more pleased if Vinzi were less happy
and showed some inclination to come home.</p>

<p>This caused new anxieties in her heart and she
wondered what would happen when Vinzi returned.
If he did according to his father&#8217;s wishes,
he would never be satisfied. And if his father let
him do the work the boy had chosen, a breach
would remain between the two, for the father
would never be reconciled to the thought that his
son would become a strolling musician. She remembered
the unspeakable joy of her husband
when their son was born. He had indefatigably
worked for the little one and nothing had ever
been too good for him. When he looked at his
son, he was glad to be able to say, &#8220;He can have
everything he wants some day.&#8221; A great pity for
her husband surged up in her at these thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and she felt as if she must call Vinzi home. But
the next moment she had to think again, &#8220;But
then poor Vinzi will feel unhappy.&#8221;</p>

<p>In her agitation she was glad that she had
nothing whatever to decide in the matter, but the
greatest consolation of all was the knowledge
that One above her, Who saw further and knew
everything would decide the final outcome for
them all.</p>

<small>OLD FRIENDS AND NEW LIFE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">SPRING was here again and all the trees
and hedges were in bloom. Stefeli could
not gaze her fill at the fresh green grass, as
she wandered through the meadows with her
school-bag on her back. The golden buttercups
were gleaming here and there among the grasses,
and red daisies were nodding merrily in
the breeze.</p>

<p>Stefeli was coming home from her last day
of school for that season. How lovely that day
had been a year ago when she had walked home
with Vinzi and they had discussed the joys of the
coming holidays. The whole summer had lain
before them with the delightful prospect of many
perfect days on the pasture. They would sit
again under the ash tree as long as they pleased,
or look for berries on the bushes. Then they
would have to chase Schwärzeli and be altogether
as free as the birds that whistled in the trees
above them. But what would the coming summer
be like? Stefeli only saw before her many hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
days to be spent in the room with her hateful
knitting. She would probably not be able to
spend one of them on the pasture, and at this
thought she sat down on the edge of the meadow
and sighed aloud.</p>

<p>But Stefeli could never remain unhappy very
long. Suddenly remembering that the wild
strawberries behind the barn had been nearly ripe
two days ago, she felt the need to inspect them.
Quickly jumping up, she ran towards the house
first, in order to rid herself of her heavy load of
books. But hurriedly flinging open the door of
the living room, she stood stock-still upon the
threshold, dumb with astonishment.</p>

<p>An unknown man sat opposite her mother
confidentially talking to her, and beside him was
a boy of Vinzi&#8217;s age who took a lively part in the
conversation. The mother was wearing a happier
face than she had shown for a long while, and
every few moments Vinzi&#8217;s name was mentioned
between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose this is your little daughter,&#8221; said
the man, glancing towards the door. &#8220;Come
here, Stefeli, I am no stranger. I am your Uncle
Lorenz, and this is Jos, a good friend of Vinzi&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stefeli came joyfully up to greet the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
whom Vinzi had loved so dearly. They seemed
very welcome just at this time when she had felt
so especially lonely. She shook Uncle Lorenz&#8217;s
hand trustfully, for he gazed at her with such
friendly eyes. It also made her happy to look
at Jos, constantly smiling at her, as if he wished
to say, &#8220;We&#8217;ll get along well together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stefeli turned towards her uncle and said
casually, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t Jos going to stay with us all
summer? You know Vinzi stayed with you just
as long as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The uncle laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I call it a real welcome to be expected to
stay all summer. But we&#8217;ll have to talk with
your father and see what he says. Why don&#8217;t
you take Jos out with you a little and see how you
get along together?&#8221;</p>

<p>This did not have to be urged. Stefeli, taking
her cousin&#8217;s hand, drew him happily after her.
He must see everything in the stable and the
barn, the garden and the chicken-yard; it was
just as if Vinzi were home again and could share
all her delights.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Vinzenz Lesa had returned from
his work and upon entering the room had greeted
his guest with a surprise and visible joy. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
state of deepening depression under which he was
laboring, his contented-looking cousin Lorenz
was a welcome sight. &#8220;We so much missed hearing
from you,&#8221; said the latter after the first
greetings, &#8220;that my wife kept teasing me about
your Vinzi. She feared we might not see him all
summer and we wanted to be sure to have him
up again for the season. I want him no less than
she does, for we miss him ever so much. We
thought we&#8217;d bring you our Jos for a while, as
we agreed to do, and then the two boys could
come up to us together till winter time. But
your wife has just told me that Vinzi has gone
away. I am mighty sorry not to see him, I must
say, and my wife will be bitterly disappointed if
he does not come. You have no idea how much
she thinks of Vinzi; but he deserves it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The parents were glad to hear their cousin&#8217;s
words about Vinzi, but remained silent. Whenever
the boy&#8217;s name was mentioned, the furrows
on Vinzenz Lesa&#8217;s brow always deepened, showing
clearly that it touched his sorest spot. His
wife therefore mentioned Vinzi as little as
she could.</p>

<p>Considerate little Stefeli by that time had felt
that it was high time for Jos to get something to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
eat. She therefore came back and entered the
room hand in hand with him. The two seemed to
be old friends already.</p>

<p>Jos went straight up to his uncle Vinzenz to
greet him. The latter looked at the open face
of the boy with a mixture of pain and delight.
Health, strength and the sheer joy of living
laughed from the lad&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be as big as you some day, Lorenz,&#8221;
said Vinzenz, after having measured Jos from
top to toe. &#8220;He must be a real help already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So he is, I can tell you!&#8221; replied Lorenz,
pleased that his cousin should find it worth while
to examine his boy thoroughly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa, who had disappeared, now opened
the door and gave Stefeli a sign. The child immediately
began to set the table, taking great
care not to forget anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wife has a good little helper, too,&#8221; said
Cousin Lorenz, watching Stefeli&#8217;s quick preparations
with great approval. &#8220;My wife would like
to have her, too. You must send her up to us
some day, but I can&#8217;t guarantee that you&#8217;ll ever
get her back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother now came in and set on the table
the best her kitchen and cellar could provide. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
was a special delight to her to entertain these
guests who had shown Vinzi so much kindness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you are going to stay with us a few
days, cousin,&#8221; she said as she settled down opposite
to him. She kept a vigilant eye on his and
the boy&#8217;s plates and constantly supplied them
with fresh rosy ham and gold-green salad leaves
from her garden. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you leave Jos here
with us for a few weeks, cousin?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>But Stefeli here pulled violently at her
mother&#8217;s apron and whispered, &#8220;Say for the
summer, mother, quickly, before he says yes,&#8221;
for she was terribly afraid that the proposal
might be accepted and then could not be changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will, cousin, and I must say you don&#8217;t
make it hard for one to stay,&#8221; replied the cousin.
&#8220;I came purposely on Saturday so I could have
a nice Sunday with you tomorrow. I&#8217;ll gladly
stay if it suits you, but I&#8217;ll have to leave on
Monday. Vinzenz shall settle what is to be done
about my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is plenty of time,&#8221; replied the latter
leisurely. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take a walk across the fields
tomorrow. I suppose you count on looking about
you here, and that will give us a good chance
to talk.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>&#8220;Look at the cow-stable before everything
else,&#8221; cried Jos enthusiastically, who had been
silent till then out of deep respect for his uncle.
But the impression he had received in the stable
was too powerful for him to be restrained. &#8220;I
am sure there are no finer cows anywhere than
in uncle&#8217;s stable. They look as clean as if they
had just been watered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you would like them,&#8221; said his
father, &#8220;and I must see them today. Do you
still have your breed from Freiburg, Vinzenz?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; retorted the other. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
change a thing if it&#8217;s good. Your boy seems to
have eyes in his head.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as they had risen from the table, the
men began their stroll through the stable and
barn. Jos and Stefeli joyfully realized their
chance to take another walk, for there were still
many things for Jos to see.</p>

<p>Early next afternoon the two men wandered
through the blooming fields and meadows of
Lesa&#8217;s property. Mrs. Lesa was taking the
children to the sunny slope where the first strawberries
were ripening, for she knew that that
would please them both. She had planned this
separation, as the men had many affairs to talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
over. Busy with observations of the blooming
trees, the luscious grass and the fields which
promised a plenteous harvest, they had reached
the slope where Lesa&#8217;s fine forest ground began.</p>

<p>Before they started up the forest path, shaded
by beautiful beech trees, Lorenz stood still a moment,
gazing down at the dwelling-house which
looked up so invitingly from the high walnut
trees surrounding it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vinzenz, you are a lucky man,&#8221; he said at
last. &#8220;Joy and peace in your house and everything
about you in such fine shape that no one
could wish for anything better. And all this is
your own property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and another place in Freiburg with
twice as many cows as here and grass enough to
fill the barn to the top.&#8221;</p>

<p>The furrow in Vinzenz Lesa&#8217;s brow grew
deeper while he spoke as if worse things yet
were coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;I get twelve cheeses a year from the milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no reason for you to despair, Vinzenz,&#8221;
said the other with laughing eyes. &#8220;I never
knew that the other place belonged to you as
well. So you have two fine properties. Well, I
can&#8217;t help wondering about you. Our Lord has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
heaped you with blessings, and you show a face
as if you had nothing but storms to battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is easy for you to talk,&#8221; said Vinzenz
grimly. &#8220;You have three fine, strong boys, fit
for work. But look at me! After all the work
I have done here, I shall have to see it go to
pieces. I can&#8217;t be in two places at once, and my
son won&#8217;t open his eyes and see the fine life that
lies before him. Hundreds might envy him.
When I inherited this place, I left my father&#8217;s
home, where every tree seemed like a comrade
and every piece of livestock had grown up under
my very eyes. You can believe me that I hated
to go. But you have no idea how run down and
neglected this place was, and I knew that no
stranger would undertake to look after it. I said
to myself that I would do it for my boy; in a few
years he would be old enough to manage it himself
and then I could go home again. I even
brought the property up more quickly than I expected
to. Don&#8217;t you yourself say that it looks
like a blooming garden from one end to the other?
Shall I let it run down again or shall I let my
other place go to such ruin that one can&#8217;t recognize
it any longer? Tell me what you think?
Don&#8217;t you think I have good cause to worry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
do you wonder I don&#8217;t sing and whistle? You
can see now how I stand!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not half so bad as you think,&#8221; retorted
Lorenz with a cheerful face. &#8220;You have a boy
who is sure to amount to something fine one day.
But you don&#8217;t only have a boy, you have a
daughter besides, who is sure to bring you
nothing but pleasure. Let six or seven years
pass. You are an active man and can easily keep
up both estates till then. By that time you can
give over this place here to your girl. She&#8217;ll
know how to look after it, and you can go back
home once more. I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if somebody
would turn up by then who would gladly
share the work and responsibility with her. Your
place will be in good hands then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lorenz was walking on but stopped once
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I nearly forgot to ask you the most important
question,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What do you want
to do with Jos? Do you wish to keep him, or
would you rather be left by yourself? He is not
slow to learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see that,&#8221; remarked Vinzenz.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll probably miss him, and I feel in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
debt already, for Vinzi was no help to you
in anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lorenz eagerly remonstrated. Vinzenz
should just hear his wife on the subject and she
would tell him something else. She herself had
suggested bringing Jos to them. She had never
wanted any of her boys to go away, but since
Vinzi had been with them, she thought that Jos
would learn only good things in such a household.
She also maintained that gratitude had to be
shown for leaving Vinzi with them so long,
besides having the hope that Vinzi might return
if Jos stayed with them for a while and was able
to serve them likewise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me frankly,&#8221; concluded the cousin,
&#8220;have you another reason for hesitating in
keeping Jos?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is my only reason,&#8221; was the firm reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Jos shall stay here and you can send
him home any time it suits you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lorenz quickened his pace now, for he wished
to have plenty of leisure left to talk with cousin
Stefane and her little daughter. He already felt
bound to them in great friendship.</p>

<p>When the evening was over, he wanted to say
good-bye to Stefeli for he had to leave early the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
next morning, when she would be sound asleep.
But Stefeli, giving her hand, refused to do so,
and in the morning, long before sunrise, she stood
under the door and looked at her uncle with
laughing eyes. She had grown so fond of this
friendly man that she did not mind getting up
so early; she had firmly made up her mind to see
him off.</p>

<p>But Stefeli also had another plan. As soon
as her uncle was downstairs she said casually,
&#8220;Can Jos stay here now? Can he stay all
summer till fall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; smilingly replied the uncle, &#8220;till
your father sends him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother had prepared steaming coffee to
strengthen her relative on his homeward journey.
Jos had got up even before Stefeli and could be
heard outside with the father. The boy had seen
the stable door open and had run in to examine
his uncle&#8217;s beautiful cows, one after the other.
Vinzenz seemed well pleased with this early visit.
The boy uttered one cry of admiration after
another, as well as suitable observations about the
different animals. For a time the farmer watched
the boy as he went from stall to stall and looked
at all the cows. But when Jos was so lost in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
contemplation of the tidy stable and its inhabitants
that he had forgotten everything else,
the uncle said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we had better go to the house
before your father leaves. He might escape
us otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, I never thought of that!&#8221; exclaimed
Jos, and bounded away like an arrow.</p>

<p>After many hearty shakings of the hand the
uncle started on his way. Vinzenz wished to
accompany him to the borders of his property,
and the others went as far as the garden hedge.</p>

<p>When the men had disappeared, Stefeli asked
quickly, &#8220;Jos, wouldn&#8217;t you like to go to the
pasture? Then I could, too, if you want me to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. But you can&#8217;t ask me what
I want,&#8221; replied Jos, &#8220;because I am not
master here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish one could be master for once,&#8221;
sighed Stefeli.</p>

<p>The father soon returned, and as the mother
had found several things to attend to in the
vegetable garden, he met all three outside. He
went up to Jos, while Stefeli stood with round
expectant eyes behind the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me you find real pleasure in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
cows, Jos. Are you willing to take charge of
them and take them to the pasture?&#8221; asked the
father. &#8220;You are your own master then all day.
I&#8217;ll leave you in absolute charge of them, for you
know what there is to do. The child can go with
you and can help in case of need. She knows all
the roads hereabouts and also a good deal about
her business. Does that suit you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;d like to do that best of all,&#8221; cried
Jos, while Stefeli leaped for joy. Then she
raced into the house after her mother, as preparations
for the day must be made at once. The
father meanwhile went to the stable with Jos, as
it was time to start.</p>

<p>Stefeli had never pictured to herself how
wonderful it would be to be outside again and to
chase her old friends and then cool off again
under the shady ash tree. Jos&#8217;s great joy in
everything he saw and experienced would have
carried Stefeli along, even if she had not been
filled with happiness and joy herself. All her old
acquaintances were there again, besides four
gorgeous new red and white spotted cows, which
her father had fetched from Freiburg. Another
young Schwärzeli was there, too, which galloped
just as merrily from one side of the pasture to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
other as Stefeli&#8217;s other favorite had done, and
often jumped over fences and bridges if they did
not catch her in time. Stefeli remembered all
their characteristics and told Jos about them.
They would get to know the four new ones before
very long.</p>

<p>Jos grasped things eagerly and always
retained his knowledge. It seemed miraculous to
Stefeli how he could outguess a cow when she
wanted to run off. Then he caressed and calmed
her. He caught Schwärzeli by the tail while
giving her first bound, before she started flying
off across the pasture like the wind. It was
exactly as if he could tell by looking at them just
when they wanted to escape. Not much running
had to be done, therefore, and Jos always said to
the child, &#8220;Just stay under the tree, Stefeli, I
can manage them quite well alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he was right. He had learned to understand
the new cows so quickly that they made
large astonished eyes when their plans to run
away were always frustrated from the start.</p>


<p>Beside his duties Jos found plenty of time
frequently to leap up for joy. Often he sang
and yodelled so loudly that it re-echoed from all
the hills. His voice was so fine and melodious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
that Stefeli was charmed by it and would beg
over and over, &#8220;Sing again, Jos, sing it for me
again.&#8221; The morning always passed so quickly
that the two looked at each other questioningly
when they heard the sounds of the noonday bell
from far away. It seemed hardly possible that
so many hours had already passed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_254fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">STEFELI ALWAYS SPREAD OUT THEIR LUNCH UNDER THE ASH TREE</p>


<p>Stefeli always spread out their lunch under
the ash tree in the good old way. After a searching
glance at the cows, who had quietly settled
down about them in the sunshine, Jos sat down
willingly by Stefeli. He first of all admired the
neatly spread repast before him, for he had never
seen a meal set out so perfectly outdoors.
The swaying branches above gave them the
needed shade.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure no one else could spread a table
as well as you can, Stefeli,&#8221; he said, full of
admiration. Then he began to eat everything
Stefeli offered him with the heartiest appetite.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed as quickly as the morning,
and when they were strolling homewards in
the bright evening light, Stefeli said, &#8220;Oh, it
was lovely today. I hope all the other days will
be exactly like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so, too,&#8221; repeated Jos.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>Vinzenz Lesa stood at his barn and watched
his herd coming home. Jos was running alongside
of the cows, first on one side and then on the
other. This kept them walking in a neat row,
instead of running first here, then there.</p>

<p>&#8220;A quick, orderly boy,&#8221; said Vinzenz Lesa to
himself, as he slowly met the procession on its
way to the stable.</p>

<p>A series of perfect days followed, and the
children had the happiest times. Stefeli&#8217;s wish
seemed to be fulfilled, for she fairly beamed with
joy and well-being all day long, and Jos sang and
yodelled louder every day from sheer happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as if Vinzi were back since Jos is
with us. Don&#8217;t you think so, mother?&#8221; said
Stefeli, coming home one day with cheeks flushed,
partly from delight and partly from the bright
light of the setting sun. Jos as usual had stayed
outside with his uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the mother. &#8220;As long as we
can&#8217;t have Vinzi, I am glad Jos takes his place.
I like Jos as much as if he belonged to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, too,&#8221; said Stefeli without hesitation.
&#8220;But there are three times when I had a better
time with Vinzi. In the morning, in the evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
and on rainy days. It was much nicer then when
Vinzi was at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother well understood what Stefeli alluded
to, but she asked the child to let Jos go on
his way, as he was doing his duty and it would be
wrong of her to hinder him in that.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have tried already, but it does no good,&#8221;
said Stefeli frankly.</p>

<p>She was forbidden to do so again. The
mother was only too glad and grateful to see how
Jos occupied himself at those times, even if
Stefeli was displeased. He did so of his own
free will, and she had noticed that it had actually
improved her husband&#8217;s temper.</p>

<p>Jos was always the first up in the morning,
and if the stable, which was his favorite resort,
was still closed, he thought of something which
had to be set in order in the barn. In this way
Vinzenz would find him busy with hammering or
mending something. The boy always came to
breakfast at the very last minute when the coffee
was put upon the table. He didn&#8217;t even notice
how impatiently Stefeli was waiting for him. In
the evening after their return Jos could not be
lured away from his cows till the last one had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
returned from watering and was comfortably
bedded on the straw.</p>

<p>The mother had always set the steaming pot
on the table before he came in. Stefeli never
could count on running over to the wild strawberry
bed with Jos, therefore.</p>

<p>On rainy days Jos always disappeared
entirely. He knew in the early morning what
work had to be done that day in the fields, the
hills, the woods or on the trees. When it rained,
he would quickly ask his uncle, &#8220;Can I go with
the man today?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other always agreed, &#8220;Why not, if you
don&#8217;t mind the rain?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rain didn&#8217;t bother Jos at all. Everything
that grew and brought in fruit interested him
so much that he wanted to see it and have a hand
in it if possible. Best of all, he liked it when the
wood which had been felled had to be brought
home from the forest. Then the horse was
hitched to a large lumber wagon and Jos sat on
the high seat beside the hired man. As soon as
they had left the house behind them the man
would say, &#8220;There, take them if you want to
drive.&#8221; Giving Jos the reins, he stretched out
full length in the wagon to sleep a little longer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Jos knew the horse well and the horse knew him,
so the matter went very smoothly. Jos had
already helped in every kind of farm work and
knew exactly when things were in order or when
something was amiss. He took hold of everything
with such spirit and eagerness that he
acquired an instinct for what was needed when
matters went wrong.</p>

<p>In the beginning Vinzenz Lesa had said to
his wife in a bitter tone,&#8220;Just look how he enjoys
everything! He works with such an eagerness,
as if it were his own. Look at the pleasure he
finds in it all! And my own boy, for whom we
work, has never even seen it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But everything had turned out to make Mrs.
Lesa happy. Her husband spoke every day in a
different tone about Jos. He could say quite
cheerfully now: &#8220;The boy has four eyes in his
head. He discovers what I overlook myself and
the man would never have seen. He actually
sees everything. I can entirely depend on him
as on no one else, and he is so handy that it is a
pleasure to see him work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa saw her husband&#8217;s growing delight
in their young nephew with hearty feelings of
gratitude. He was in a much better humor than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
he had been for years. When during the afternoon
she was sitting quietly and undisturbed in
her room, her thoughts unerringly dwelt upon
Vinzi and she pondered about his future. She
wondered if he would return after a year and
take up the life his father wished him to, in which
case he would never be really happy. Or if he
had definitely chosen a new path for himself,
which would forever estrange him from his
father. She lost herself in imaginary conversations
with her son, and the slightest noise made
her start up, as she would think that her boy
might have suddenly returned.</p>

<p>So it happened one day when her thoughts
had been busy with Vinzi that the housedoor was
opened and the noise of several footsteps neared
the room. Mrs. Lesa had jumped up and running
to the door had quickly opened it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old friends, who are looking for shelter in
your house,&#8221; said a vigorous man&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>That same instant a slight hand grasped hers,
then another. Only then could she really see them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome! Welcome, Alida, Hugo! Welcome,
Mr. Thornau!&#8221; she cried, heartily
delighted. &#8220;Are you staying in our parts again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly, but we are here for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
present,&#8221; said Mr. Thornau, returning her
friendly handshake. &#8220;We&#8217;ll stay here, if you
will receive us. But if you say no, we&#8217;ll have to
wander home again. Before everything else, I
must tell you that I am bringing you two
children who have lost their mother. They have
asked me to come here, for nowhere else
will suit them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa was won over already. &#8220;The
poor children,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;and the poor
father,&#8221; she added. Then she turned to the latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Thornau,&#8221; she said, &#8220;won&#8217;t you stay
here till evening when my husband comes home?
Then we can talk it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what does his wife say?&#8221; asked
Mr. Thornau.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she would love to take their mother&#8217;s
place for a time, if she could,&#8221; replied Mrs. Lesa.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad!&#8221; he exclaimed with satisfaction.</p>

<p>He was willing to wait for Mr. Lesa and
settled meanwhile under the shady walnut trees
with his children.</p>

<p>Vinzenz Lesa looked with surprise at the
guests he found waiting before his house. But
there was not much time for wondering, because
Mr. Thomau had gone up to him and eloquently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
informed him of the reason for this visit. He
was sure Mr. Lesa would not shut his door
against him and especially his children, who had
declared that they would not spend their summer
anywhere in the world except at Mr. Lesa&#8217;s residence.
He had come with the firm hope that Mr.
Lesa would not turn them away and begged him
not to propose a house in the neighborhood they
already knew, as the children simply would not
go back there. He had no intention, either, of
forcing them to it. It meant either Mr. Lesa&#8217;s
house or going home again. As it was impossible
for him to stay with the children just then, he
could not leave them anywhere else alone.</p>

<p>Vinzenz Lesa was not displeased at hearing
the gentleman&#8217;s words&mdash;either his house or none.
But still, one could not tell what these children
might bring into his home, for he hardly knew
the people.</p>

<p>After reflecting a while he answered, &#8220;It
falls to my wife; looking after children is
her affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>This suited him best. If his wife wanted to
keep them, as he suspected already, it would be
his wife&#8217;s concern. If they got into mischief, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
would have to look out for them, for she had
taken them in.</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure,&#8221; replied Mr. Thornau.
Quickly turning to Mrs. Lesa he said, &#8220;Everything
is settled, I suppose, for I think you have
already said yes in your heart.&#8221; Mrs. Lesa
heartily shook Mr. Thornau&#8217;s hand, for he had
been right. She had long ago decided to keep
the motherless children and show them all the
affection she was capable of.</p>

<p>Mr. Thornau was anxious to take immediate
leave, as he had planned to journey on as soon as
he knew his children were in good hands. Then
Mrs. Lesa consulted him about their life, what
their occupations and pleasures were to be. Her
own children had always led the most simple life,
she told him. Mr. Thornau wished for nothing
better than to give them the life hers were leading.
To be up on the pasture from morning till
evening would be the best for them he could hope
for. The rest of the time Mrs. Lesa could
judge for herself.</p>

<p>To his great disappointment Alida&#8217;s music
lessons had been given up. He had always
enjoyed her playing. His chief wish was to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
them both come back to him sunburnt and with
blooming cheeks, just as her own lad looked.</p>

<p>Taking Mrs. Lesa a little apart, pointing
to his sad-looking, pale boy, he added, &#8220;I am sure
I won&#8217;t have to specially recommend him to your
care. Just look at him! He never was very
strong or happy, and since he has lost his mother
he is worse than ever. No life, no spirits, no
interest in anything! The doctor actually
insisted on my sending him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Thornau quickly took farewell till the
autumn, when he planned to see them all.</p>

<p>Just then Jos and Stefeli, merrily chatting,
came home with the cows. Jos disappeared in
the stable as usual and Stefeli slowly approached
the house. There was no hurry, for her mother
was busy in the kitchen and Jos would not come
back yet for at least an hour.</p>

<p>Suddenly her slow steps turned into great
leaps, for at the strawberry hedge she had discovered
two figures. Could it really be true?
And yet it was! With a cry of joy Stefeli
ran over to Alida and Hugo. Alida also
greeted Stefeli with loud, continued expressions
of delight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>&#8220;But where is Vinzi?&#8221; asked Alida when the
greetings were over.</p>

<p>Stefeli told her how long he had been away
and that no one knew when he would come back.</p>

<p>Alida looked extremely disappointed, but
Stefeli always had a consolation ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure he&#8217;ll come home while you are
here. Jos is here, too, and you&#8217;ll be sure to like
him. Will you stay all summer long?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alida assented. &#8220;And we are to spend our
days on the pasture, because papa wants us to,&#8221;
she added, &#8220;but it is a shame Vinzi won&#8217;t be
with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stefeli answered Alida that it was never dull
up on the pasture. Her father had prophesied
a long stretch of good weather, and that meant
that they would be out of doors all day.</p>

<p>Mr. Lesa had been right. The merry little
group could wander up day after day to the
sunny pasture, and Mrs. Lesa saw to it that a
really nourishing meal was always taken along.
Alida was in perfect raptures over this free life,
hitherto unknown to her. What a blissful
beginning of the day to start off in the early
morning, when she was usually lying asleep in
bed behind her heavy curtains! How delicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the pure air was! All the birds in the trees sang
and whistled so that it sounded like a loud chorus
of joy to God.</p>

<p>The two girls would start out together on
little trips to explore the interesting places on the
large, wide pasture. Sometimes they would seek
berries or flowers; another time they went to the
old wall where the shining lizards sunned themselves,
or listened attentively when the children
began to sing. Stefeli knew that if they were
silent or made the least movement, the little green
creatures would quickly slip away. Alida found
it an especial treat to be able to sit down anywhere
on the sun-dried ground. She had not
experienced this before and it gave her constant
pleasure. Stefeli was always ready to settle
down beside her, and everything furnished them
with subjects for lively conversation.</p>

<p>On the first morning, when Stefeli had
promised to waken Alida early, both girls stood
fresh and full of enterprise before the barn,
waiting for Jos. He had to loosen the cows from
their chains before driving them out. Hugo had
come down from his room, because his father had
wished him to go along to the pasture.</p>

<p>He looked so frail and tired that it hurt Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Lesa to look at him. She led him affectionately
back to his room, and fixing the cushions on his
bed, told him to rest a little longer. There was
no hurry for him to go, for a little later on she
would take him up and show him the way herself.
He would never have to start quite so early, if he
did not want to.</p>

<p>For the first time since he had lost his mother,
Hugo felt himself sheltered again by a mother&#8217;s
affectionate care. From that day on a great love
for her began to fill his heart. She watched over
him like a mother and saw to it that everything
was done for him that might do him good. In
these first days the quiet boy, who was still bearing
a great sorrow in his heart, spent many hours
alone in Mrs. Lesa&#8217;s company. He found great
consolation in it and learned to feel such confidence
in her that he began to talk about his
mother. She listened with such sympathy that
they always returned to that subject when he was
with her.</p>

<p>The comfort the boy found in her warm
interest was soon apparent. One day Hugo
came down quite early into the gleaming sunshine.
He had never done it since that first day
when he had looked so pale and tired. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
already seemed much stronger and to Mrs.
Lesa&#8217;s joy wished to go right up to the pasture.
Till then he had preferred to sit in the house till
she sent him out and accompanied him part way.</p>

<p>Hugo found Jos alone on the pasture, singing
and whistling while he strolled about among
the cows. Alida and Stefeli had gone on a little
trip of discovery. It seemed as if Hugo saw the
beautiful creatures who were grazing here and
there, looking about them, for the first time in his
life. He began to ask Jos many questions, for
after watching them carefully he had noticed how
much they differed in their looks as well as in
their ways. He had always thought that cows
were just cows, one like another. Jos was in his
element now and grew talkative, drawing
Hugo&#8217;s attention to all the animals&#8217; habits. The
subject proved so contagious that Hugo conceived
a keen interest in them and wanted to hear
all about them. He only had to ask to be told
what he wished to know. Jos could describe
them with such keen vividness that Hugo grew
most eager to share Jos&#8217;s knowledge and to find
pleasure in it. He soon knew what fodder was
the best for milk, which was made first into
butter and then into cheese, and how the milk had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
to be handled for that purpose. He also learned
that the Alpine herdsmen preferred Vinzenz
Lesa&#8217;s milk to any other because his cows were of
the best stock and were so immaculately kept.</p>

<p>The two were still talking eagerly when to
their great astonishment Stefeli came running
toward them and spread out their mid-day meal
under the swaying ash tree. They had been so
lost in their conversation that they had not
noticed how the time had flown. This had suited
Stefeli, too, because she had come back rather
late from her expedition. Alida also appeared
and in the best of humor as the four sat down to
lunch. All of them felt especially merry, because
Hugo had never been so lively and gay.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll pretend we are a family,&#8221; suggested
Alida, &#8220;and we must always stay the same.
Hugo is the proprietor of an estate and I am
his sister, the unmarried lady of the mansion.
Jos is our manager.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Stefeli can be the mistress,&#8221; was
Hugo&#8217;s proposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Hugo, she couldn&#8217;t be,&#8221; Jos cried out.
&#8220;Stefeli cooks for us and sets the table. She
couldn&#8217;t be the gentleman&#8217;s wife, she must be
my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>&#8220;Jos is right,&#8221; decided Alida, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have it
that way, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see the owner has a mother; that&#8217;s
much better than a wife,&#8221; said Hugo. &#8220;When
Mrs. Lesa visits us some day, you&#8217;ll have to
receive her as my mother and prepare a great
feast for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>This thought met great approval, and they
began to plan immediately for this feast. Alida
invented such astonishing plans for the celebration
with torches and rockets that Jos said,
&#8220;Then our cows will all jump over the hedges
from fright and the people at the feast will have
to climb after them in their festive jackets.&#8221;</p>

<p>All four burst into loud laughter at this
picture, which brought a sudden end to these
extravagant plans. Their meal was ended and
they settled here and there in the shadows of the
broad branches. Soon all four were sound
asleep, fanned by the leafy bows above them.
They slept as well as if they had been lying on
regal couches. On Hugo&#8217;s pale cheeks the air
and sunshine, gently caressing him, roused a
faint rosy color.</p>

<p>Talking merrily, the whole company afterward
came wandering down from the pasture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
aglow from the golden light of the setting sun.
As usual Jos went to the stable and Hugo disappeared
with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, now he begins it, too,&#8221; said
Stefeli. &#8220;I only wonder what he wants to do
there still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just let him go,&#8221; remarked Alida, &#8220;I am
glad of it. He is much happier when he is with
Jos. I have noticed that today.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE OLD SONG ONCE MORE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AUTUMN was here. In Lesa&#8217;s household
it had come much too soon for every one,
and the children could not believe that
their days on the pasture were nearly over.
Hugo and Alida would soon have to go right into
the heart of a large city far away. Jos would go
home to his mountain, while poor Stefeli would
be left behind, unhappy and alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be always alone,&#8221; said
Stefeli determinedly, when they had discussed
their prospects on one of their last days together.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll send a letter to Uncle Lorenz. You know
he promised me something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose Vinzi will soon come back,&#8221; said
Alida, &#8220;and he&#8217;ll be wonderful company for you.
We would have had lots more fun if he had been
with us this summer. There were so many things
I wanted to talk to him about, things none of you
could understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same day Vinzenz Lesa said to his wife,
&#8220;I hope Lorenz won&#8217;t come yet to fetch Jos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
home. It has been such a good year that we still
have our hands full. Things have to be done on
every side and I can&#8217;t do them without the boy.
He has the best memory and such good ideas;
common sense, besides, enough for three, and a
love and interest in the work as if it were all for
himself, instead of for us. He just wants to keep
the farm in good shape. I would give half the
place to have such a son. It would mean so
much to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be glad he is still with us,&#8221; replied the
wife, &#8220;and I think he&#8217;ll stay yet for a while.
Good Cousin Lorenz hasn&#8217;t even warned us yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick sent word from time to time, and
a letter had come rather lately with the usual
good news. Vinzi was well and everything going
smoothly. Mr. Delrick seemed to be in no hurry
for Vinzi&#8217;s return, though the year of his absence
was practically over.</p>

<p>A few days later when the children walked
into the room one night a large letter lay on
the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s from papa,&#8221; cried Alida, upon seeing
the handwriting. It was addressed to
Mr. Lesa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now everything is over,&#8221; said Hugo, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
had come in also. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find that we&#8217;ll have to
go now, Alida.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children were quite frightened, for even
while they had discussed their departure, none of
them had realized how near it really was. Even
Jos, who had joined them, made large, bewildered
eyes. He had never quite pictured to himself
the end of their bliss, and just lately least of all,
when he and Hugo had been drawn so closely to
each other in friendship. Should this all be over
for good now, with their separation?</p>

<p>As soon as the father came in, he took up the
letter, only to put it aside again. He only read
letters when there was nothing else to do, and
supper was more important. When Mrs. Lesa
had brought it in and had looked after every one&#8217;s
needs, she asked her husband if she should open
the letter. She knew that the children, who had
recognized their father&#8217;s handwriting, were most
anxious to hear it. As he willingly agreed, she
first read the message to herself. All she told
them, however, was that Mr. Thornau would
arrive in a few days to fetch his children home.
They would hear about the rest the next day. A
deep silence followed. Soon the four children
quietly stole away from the table, one by one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
They met outside under the large walnut tree
according to a previous plan. Here, under the
old tree as a staunch witness, they gave each other
the solemn promise to do everything in their
power to reunite next summer. They longed to
spend as perfect a summer together again.
When the children had gone to bed and Vinzenz
Lesa had lit his pipe, Mrs. Lesa sat down beside
him to read aloud Mr. Thornau&#8217;s letter. He was
writing from Dresden, where he had stopped a
few days. He had gone there to see Mr. Delrick,
who had decided to join him on his trip to
Switzerland. This would give him an opportunity
personally to bring the parents news about
their son. But, as Mr. Thornau&#8217;s time was
extremely limited, he unfortunately would have
to take the last train to Leuk on Sunday evening
and leave again with the earliest train on
Monday. He therefore made them a proposal.
If the Lesa family, including their little
daughter, would bring his children to Freiburg
on Sunday, they could all spend a pleasant day
together in that city. As Freiburg was Mr.
Lesa&#8217;s former home, Mr. Thornau had a hope
that it was possible to persuade Mr. Lesa to go
there. They might arrive early on Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
afternoon, and he and Mr. Delrick would meet
them at the train, as they expected to reach
Freiburg earlier.</p>

<p>In conclusion he said that Mr. Lesa and his
wife would, by doing him this favor, crown their
former kindness to his children. A refusal of his
expectations would mean no less to him than a
hailstorm to Mr. Lesa&#8217;s fields.</p>

<p>Vinzenz Lesa remained silent for quite a
while. Then he asked, &#8220;Does he write nothing
about our boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa answered that the only thing about
Vinzi was what she had read, namely, that Mr.
Delrick was anxious to give them news about the
boy in person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know why he doesn&#8217;t want to bring
him?&#8221; asked Lesa further.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t know that,&#8221; replied the wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we can guess, and I&#8217;ll tell you why.
The reason is that Mr. Delrick realizes that he
mustn&#8217;t make him into a travelling musician. He
is in no hurry to bring him home, because he has
turned his thoughts further than ever from farming
and he is afraid to tell me. I know he is a
good man, but he has made a mistake. Everybody
dislikes admitting such a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>Vinzenz Lesa blew such thick clouds of smoke
from his pipe that his wife found it advisable to
let them disperse a little. Then she said
cautiously, &#8220;I think we had better hear first what
Mr. Delrick has to say. It will be a blessing to
be able to talk to him. What do you say about
going to Freiburg?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t think of going,&#8221; said her
husband curtly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose I&#8217;ll go as
far as that for no reason whatever. Why should
I go to Freiburg, as if I had nothing else to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody who knows you could possibly
think that,&#8221; said his wife. &#8220;Besides, Mr.
Thornau hasn&#8217;t fixed it on a Sunday for nothing.
He knows well enough you wouldn&#8217;t come during
the week. He asks us most politely, and it would
have been easy for him to tell any other person to
fetch the children home. Apparently, he would
value it very much if we took the children to him.
I must admit, Vinzenz, that I have grown
extremely fond of them. They have both clearly
shown me how they hate to leave. I&#8217;d love to go
and put them into his hands myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go with them, then?&#8221; he
retorted, still showing an obstinate disinclination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
in his voice. &#8220;You had better go to Freiburg.
You are sufficient escort for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Vinzenz, I won&#8217;t do it,&#8221; answered his
wife with firm decision. &#8220;You can see from the
letter that Mr. Thornau wants you, too. You
also know that I couldn&#8217;t settle with Mr. Delrick
what is further to be done about the boy. We&#8217;ll
either go together, or we won&#8217;t go at all. It is
for you to decide.&#8221;</p>

<p>The silence which followed proved too long
for Mrs. Lesa and she began again. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
really see why we shouldn&#8217;t go to Freiburg as
long as they ask us to. Don&#8217;t you remember how
delighted we used to be as children when father
and mother would take us there on a Sunday?
We were the happiest creatures on earth sitting
in the high carriage between them with such
exciting adventures before us. We really should
do it for memory&#8217;s sake. We always went to
church first and heard the beautiful organ. Do
you remember how your mother insisted on doing
this first of all? Wouldn&#8217;t it give you pleasure
to go back? It also would give you a splendid
chance to run over to your farm. You ought to
have looked it over long ago, and you are sure to
find lots of things to attend to. Now that Jos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
is with us, you can leave much more easily than
afterward. You&#8217;ll have a lot of important
things to do there, and if nothing special takes
you there, you&#8217;ll never make up your mind to
go. You had better take the journey before
something actually goes wrong and you might
have reason to blame yourself for not having
gone before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The thought that the trip might have a good
side had begun to take hold of Vinzenz Lesa.
Very deliberately, but still unwillingly, he
replied, &#8220;How did you think of all these things?
I don&#8217;t see how we could be away so long. It
would take at least three days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for everybody,&#8221; replied Mrs. Lesa
promptly, for she had thought out everything
minutely. &#8220;We can easily attend to things here
on Sunday morning before leaving. We&#8217;ll be in
Freiburg early in the afternoon and that same
evening I&#8217;ll travel home as far as I can with the
children, in order to get here as soon as possible
on Monday morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many children do you expect to bring
home? The two strangers will have gone and
you yourself have only one.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>This time the husband had found the words
first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only our two, Jos and Stefeli; I don&#8217;t mean
to bring strangers home,&#8221; his wife said calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! You want to take Jos along, too?&#8221;
said Vinzenz Lesa much excited. &#8220;That would
make it out of the question for me to go. If Jos
isn&#8217;t home to keep things in order, I won&#8217;t even
budge from here! Count on that.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Lesa began to show him how easily
their hired man could look after the simple work
in the stable which had to be done on Sunday.
Monday morning Jos would be back again. In
this way nothing would be neglected. &#8220;Just
think, Vinzenz,&#8221; concluded his wife, &#8220;what Jos
has done for us. He has been with us a long
while and we have not done the slightest thing
for him. I am sure it would give him pleasure to
go along. We owe it only to him if you have
time now to look over your other farm to see what
has to be done there. You can easily stay away
a week, for I promise to look after the farm if I
have Jos, so you won&#8217;t need to grumble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzenz Lesa was a just man, eager to act
upon what he felt to be right. He was glad to
give Jos a well-earned holiday and to have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
opportunity besides of carrying out a needful
undertaking. After weighing the matter carefully,
he finally declared, &#8220;All right, we&#8217;ll go
then, but tell Jos about it as soon as possible. He
can plan things out beforehand so everything
will stay in order while he is gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tomorrow,&#8221; said Mrs. Lesa, happy at
having such pleasant prospects to tell the
children, especially her ever-willing Jos.</p>

<p>At the news of their coming expedition the
children showed unbounded delight. Alida and
Stefeli jumped from sheer enthusiasm and Hugo
said, &#8220;Now everything isn&#8217;t quite over yet. It
will be much easier for us to go away if everybody
comes along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jos could hardly realize the treat that lay
before him. It was too wonderful to be taken to
Freiburg and see the city and get a glimpse of
the fine country on the way. From joy and
astonishment he could scarcely say a word. It
would be his first journey, for he had never been
away from his mountain except when he had
come to Leuk.</p>

<p>Sunday arrived. The whole company
travelled gaily across the beautiful country which
lay gleaming in the brightest sunshine. The trip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
proved even more delightful than they had anticipated.
Alida and Stefeli never stopped talking,
and Hugo kept busy either joining in with them
or pointing out the interesting things along the
way, which they would have overlooked on
account of their constant chatter. Jos, on the
contrary, was so absorbed in the new, beautiful
things on every side that he never took his eyes
from the landscape and remained in the deepest
silence, attentively gazing out.</p>

<p>Thus the hours flew by unnoticed. Quite
surprised, the children jumped up from their
seats when the father said, &#8220;Look out, now, we
are nearly at Freiburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few minutes the name was actually
called out and the train stopped. Mrs. Lesa
looked out of the window expectantly to see if
the gentlemen had come to meet them. Sure
enough, there they were. But the mother uttered
a low sigh. She had hoped till the last moment
that Mr. Delrick, as a surprise, had brought their
boy with him. But Vinzi wasn&#8217;t there.</p>

<p>Loud cries of joy beside her drew her attention
to the two children, who flung themselves
upon their father. Mr. Thornau now held them
both in his arms and responded to their stormy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
greetings with exclamations of joyous surprise.
He held his son a short distance from him and
looked at him happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;And is this supposed to be my thin, frail
Hugo, who had neither spirit nor strength. You
look as sunburnt as a woodsman, with your fat
cheeks and beaming eyes. Mrs. Lesa,&#8221; he called
to the mother, &#8220;what did you do with him? He
is a different creature. And is this stalwart
gipsy girl really my Alida? The blood throbs
through your brown cheeks with health. Mrs.
Lesa, Mrs. Lesa, how on earth did you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we know, we know how,&#8221; cried out the
children simultaneously, and immediately began
to relate to the father how they had spent
their delicious summer days. It would have
been impossible for Mrs. Lesa to give any
information now.</p>

<p>After greeting her husband, Mr. Delrick
took Mrs. Lesa&#8217;s hand. Just is if he had read
from her eyes what was in her heart, he said,
&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about Vinzi, Mrs. Lesa. He is
perfectly well, and he is still a great joy to me.
The reason why he is not here is not a bad one,
you must believe me. Oh, here is my little
Stefeli, too, and another old friend besides,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
continued, turning toward the children. &#8220;I am
glad Jos came, too, for he must belong entirely
to your family by now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, like our own,&#8221; said Mrs. Lesa, putting
her arms around the boy. &#8220;Thank God that we
have him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to ask what you think about a plan
we made,&#8221; continued Mr. Delrick. &#8220;I wonder
what Mr. Lesa will say. Our friend, Mr.
Thornau, has asked us all to dinner today at a
hotel quite near the beautiful old Nicholas
church. So we thought it would be pleasant to
go there first of all and then have a nice, quiet
time together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa glanced at her husband, for she
wanted him to decide. She herself was most
anxious to go to the church immediately. Old
memories had risen in Vinzenz Lesa&#8217;s mind as
soon as he had set his foot in Freiburg. As a
child he had known nothing more wonderful than
to drive to Freiburg on a Sunday, and his little
girl neighbor had felt the same. He had always
loved to enter the tall, quiet church holding his
mother&#8217;s hand. Whenever he heard the sounds
of the wonderful organ, they revealed to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
a different world, one quite apart from his
daily life.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be only too glad to go to church first,&#8221;
he began. &#8220;It is but suitable that we should go,
as it is Sunday today.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the little company started off into the
town. It was very still in the large old church,
and so dark and solemn that the children stepped
very lightly before settling down beside their
parents. Suddenly the organ began to play, and
rich, powerful tones floated through the quiet
building. It seemed as if all the heavenly hosts
were singing a hymn of praise and joy for all
the world.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_284fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">RICH, POWERFUL TONES FLOATED THROUGH THE QUIET CHURCH</p>

<p>Stefeli uttered a low cry and violently pulled
her mother&#8217;s sleeve. &#8220;It is Vinzi, mother,&#8221; she
said in intense excitement. The mother also had
recognized her boy&#8217;s curly head at her first glance
toward the organ. It had so surprised and
overcome her that she could barely keep from
sobbing aloud.</p>

<p>She wanted her husband to share her deep
emotion. Quietly touching him, she whispered,
&#8220;Vinzenz, it is Vinzi.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave no reply, nor looked up, seemingly
unwilling to show he had been moved. The music<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
suddenly changed. From a low plaint it swelled
to a tremendous wail, is if a chorus of despairing
creatures were cast down by sorrow and contrition.
In the midst of this, their grief reached
its height and changed into meek, ardent entreaties
for help and mercy. At that moment
the heavens seemed to open and a clear, lovely
chant of angels brought down a message of love
and eternal joy. Just in the middle of the angels&#8217;
choir, a rich, clear voice rang out and filled the
church with the words:</p>

<p>&#8220;And the blessed song of mercy&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Jos, upon hearing the well-known sounds, so
much more glorious and inspiring than he had
ever imagined them, had been completely carried
away. At the ending where he had always
joined in he could not stop himself from lustily
singing his words to the chorus of angels.</p>

<p>When the last tone faded away a deep silence
reigned in the church. After a while both
gentlemen rose. Vinzenz Lesa also got up, but
he had been obliged to wipe his eyes a number
of times.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you believe such a thing,&#8221; he said
to his wife in a hoarse voice in answer to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
words she had whispered to him. &#8220;No one can
tell me that was Vinzi.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick stood immediately behind him.
&#8220;Mr. Lesa,&#8221; he said, patting him on the shoulder,
&#8220;we don&#8217;t need to believe anything till we have
gone to the organ to see for ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can certainly play, I know that,&#8221; said
Mr. Thornau satisfied. &#8220;How did you like
it, Alida?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was wonderful and I wish it were not
over yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let us go along, too. I&#8217;d love to see
who played,&#8221; and taking his daughter&#8217;s hand,
Mr. Thornau followed the others up to the organ
loft. Mr. Delrick had quickly gone ahead, and
before the others had arrived, the same joyful
melody greeted them again. Vinzenz Lesa, upon
entering, stood stock still. At the organ really
sat his curly-headed boy. As he was playing,
the father could actually hear how he produced
those stirring melodies. Nothing helped now,
and Lesa had to wipe his eyes repeatedly.</p>

<p>Vinzi had ceased, and his mother finally let
Stefeli&#8217;s hand go. The child rushed to her
brother and tenderly clung to him. Now the
father came up with Mr. Delrick.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>&#8220;Mr. Lesa,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your son has played
you the song of mercy, and I hope you will also
be merciful and forgive him if he does not want
to become a farmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lesa had grasped his son&#8217;s hand. &#8220;More
than that, more than that, Vinzi,&#8221; he finally said
after a great effort to control himself. &#8220;You
make your parents proud of you and not what I
used to think. I never realized such a thing
could happen. I never, never knew it. When I
used to come to Freiburg as a boy and heard this
organ, I thought that people who played it were
creatures entirely set apart, not human beings
like one of us. You must be most thankful
to Mr. Delrick, boy, for we owe him everything.
He found the way for you and made
this possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I, Mr. Lesa, not I,&#8221; Mr. Delrick
remonstrated. &#8220;Pater Silvanus is the one who
knew what was in Vinzi and who knew what
ought to be done with him. Let us be grateful
to him. You shall also know right away that
Vinzi is not losing time with a breadless art. He
already has an offer from a church in Dresden to
play every Sunday. I suppose you approve of
that, Mr. Lesa? He&#8217;ll be able to keep on studying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
at the same time and I think the longer the
better. I hope it will suit you to leave him with
me for a few more years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever you deem wise, sir,&#8221; Lesa replied,
unhesitatingly, perfectly convinced that Mr.
Delrick&#8217;s plans and his would evermore agree.
Vinzenz Lesa was pleased that his friend had
kept a long silence about Vinzi, until he could
really prove his case.</p>

<p>One surprise after another was in store for
Vinzi. When Jos suddenly stepped up to him,
Vinzi greeted his old friend with the greatest joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it was you, after all!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I
heard you singing down in the church and it
nearly upset me. I had to think over and over
again: &#8216;Who knows our song and has a voice
just like Jos&#8217;s?&#8217; But I thought you couldn&#8217;t be
here, and here you are, after all.&#8221; In the greatest
surprise he greeted Alida, Hugo and Mr.
Thornau. Alida found so many things to talk
over with Vinzi about their past and future that
Mr. Thornau found it wise to announce that the
moment for dinner had arrived. Then all their
conversations could be continued at leisure.</p>

<p>However much Mr. Lesa fought against it,
he was taken to dinner at the Zohringer Hotel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>,
where he had not set his foot in his life before.
Unfortunately the hour of parting came much
too soon for them all.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what I have to thank you
for,&#8221; said Mr. Thornau to Vinzenz Lesa at leave-taking.
&#8220;My son, who never has shown the
slightest inclination nor wish for any occupation,
has just informed me that he has decided to
become a landowner. After having already
chosen the manager for his estate, he insists on
getting all his cows from you. He says you have
the finest that can be found anywhere, and he
knows all about the breed. My daughter has
been fighting against studying music for over a
year and has not once opened her beautiful piano
in spite of all my remonstrances. Now she
declares to me that it is her highest wish to take
up her lessons again. Hearing her former pupil
play so beautifully makes her ambitious to work
hard and catch up with him. I really mean it
most seriously, Mr. Lesa, when I say that my
gratitude for everything that my children have
experienced in your house is much greater than
I can say. I would love to prove it to you.
Don&#8217;t you ever expect to get to Hamburg,
Mr. Lesa?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t believe so,&#8221; said the latter truthfully.
&#8220;But we are glad if the children have
profited somewhat. We liked to have them and
would like them to come again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Thornau pressed Mrs. Lesa&#8217;s hand most
gratefully, for his children had told him so much
about her that he knew she had been a real mother
to them. &#8220;Will you let the children come back
again?&#8221; he asked sincerely.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would make me quite unhappy if they
didn&#8217;t come next summer,&#8221; she said half sadly,
half happily, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll look forward to their
coming every summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon taking leave of Mr. Lesa, Mr. Delrick
told him that they would see each other again, as
he was planning to spend Vinzi&#8217;s holidays in
Leuk. But first he intended to go to the Simplon
in order to show Pater Silvanus how his pupil
had progressed. If the father had no objection
he would take Vinzi with him. Lesa replied that
Mr. Delrick should do whatever he thought best.</p>

<p>Vinzi, who was standing beside them, listened
breathlessly. What had his father said? How
could he say this when he had forbidden him so
emphatically to go back to the mountain?</p>

<p>Anxious to know the truth, he asked a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
timidly, &#8220;Father, can I really go to the mountain
with Mr. Delrick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may do whatever Mr. Delrick says,&#8221;
replied the father.</p>

<p>Vinzi&#8217;s eyes sparkled with delight. He was
to return to the mountain in a few days and see
every one he had loved so dearly. He would be
able to thank Pater Silvanus, as he fully realized
how much he had to be grateful for.</p>

<p>That same hour all separated. The children
found it quite impossible to get done with their
leave-taking. Whenever they seemed to have
finished, they began again. But they were far
from sad, as they had the sure prospect of meeting
again next summer. Vinzi was to be with
them also, as Mr. Delrick had promised to come
to Leuk at the beginning of his holidays. Mr.
Thornau travelled in the direction of Basle, and
Vinzenz Lesa toward Bulle, near his paternal
home. Mr. Delrick and Mrs. Lesa, with the
three children, journeyed toward Lausanne on
the lake of Geneva. Here they spent the night
in order to arrive home as soon as possible the
next morning.</p>

<p>On the evening of the following day Vinzi
went upstairs with his mother. When they came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
to his little room, he said to her. &#8220;Oh, mother,
it is so lovely to be at home again; won&#8217;t you
please come in and say good-night to me the way
you used to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before going to bed that night Stefeli had run
outside, as if looking for some one. She found
Mr. Delrick sitting on the bench as usual, just as
she had expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you go to the mountain, Mr. Delrick,
will you give somebody a message from me?&#8221;
she inquired, as soon as she had joined him.</p>

<p>After expressing his readiness to do so, Stefeli
went on: &#8220;Won&#8217;t you please tell Uncle Lorenz
that Jos mustn&#8217;t go home yet. He promised to
leave him here till father sends him away, and I
know that he&#8217;ll never do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Delrick promised faithfully to deliver
her message. He could not help smiling to himself
when he remembered how similar were the
three messages he was asked to take. Mr. Lesa
had begged his cousin Lorenz to leave Jos with
him, if possible, as he could hardly live without
the boy. A few moments later Jos had appeared,
very anxious to let his father know that he could
not yet come home. So much had still to be done
before the winter, and then spring would be here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
again. This year&#8217;s work could barely be finished
before next year&#8217;s labors would begin. His
Uncle Vinzenz should really not be left alone, for
it was settled now that Vinzi would stay away for
good. Mr. Delrick said to himself with a smile
that Cousin Lorenz would not be able to gainsay
this threefold request, especially against his own
firm promise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lesa went into Vinzi&#8217;s room and sat
down on his bed. This vividly brought back to
her the dreadful evening before he had departed
for the Simplon. It was the first time Vinzi had
been left alone with his mother since his return.
He began to pour out his heart to her and told
her all about his life in Dresden. He had not
written, because his father had said that it was no
good. He could not relate enough of Mr.
Delrick&#8217;s fatherly kindness to him in every way.
Vinzi was allowed to study many things, especially
music. One splendid teacher taught him
to play the organ and the other gave him instructions
in the laws of music. From the latter he
had learned to understand these and all their
marvels. This lesson had been a great joy to
him and he had been impatient for it every time.</p>

<p>&#8220;But my organ lesson was better yet,&#8221; Vinzi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
added. &#8220;Oh, mother, I never realized one could
look forward so much to anything. It was always
like a great feast to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>With boundless happiness the mother looked
at the radiant eyes of her boy. &#8220;And isn&#8217;t it part
of your happiness, Vinzi, to live with Mr.
Delrick? It must be wonderful to belong to his
home and be with him so much!&#8221; she inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and not a small part of it either,&#8221; he
cried out. &#8220;I am glad you know him, otherwise
you could have no idea how kind, affectionate
and helpful he is. Everybody in his house is good
to me, too, for his sake. Mrs. Wyneken, his
housekeeper, who has charge of everything, is as
kind to me as if she were my grandmother.
Frederick the butler, and Minnie, the maid, both
wait on me and won&#8217;t let me do anything for
myself. It is mostly because they all love to hear
me play the organ. Mrs. Wyneken says that
Mr. Delrick has grown happy again since I play
it. He had lost every one in the world he loved
and had been very sad. He has a little organ in
a large room downstairs. Mr. Delrick asks me
to play it for him every night. Sometimes we
can hardly stop. Now you know what my life
in Dresden is like. But I cannot say how much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
I look forward to my little hayloft on the
mountain under the stars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vinzi,&#8221; said the mother, &#8220;do you ever thank
God for all the blessings He has heaped upon
you. Do you realize that it is He who has given
you everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do, mother,&#8221; he replied, looking
frankly into her eyes. &#8220;I never forget how
frightened and troubled I often was. Sometimes
we sing one of the songs you taught me in the
evening, but I sing them quite differently now.
I used only to enjoy the tune, but now I thank
and praise God from the bottom of my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you should ever get into a difficult
position, Vinzi,&#8221; the mother concluded, &#8220;you
must remember that God often means to work
out our good when we fear evil. When I sat on
this bed before you went away the first time, I
should in my shortsightedness have done everything
to keep you home. And just think!
That journey proved the beginning of your
great happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vinzi had listened attentively. &#8220;It was the
same with me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thought it was the
most dreadful thing that could happen to me and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
it proved just the opposite. I&#8217;ll always remember
that, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the mother left Vinzi&#8217;s chamber after
a hearty good-night, her heart was filled with
gratitude and bliss. Folding her hands she sent
up a heartfelt prayer of thanks to Heaven.</p>

<p>What blessings God had sent to her and her
household. Her boy&#8217;s inmost wish had been fulfilled
and his future lay clearly before him. The
father was not only satisfied, but actually
pleased. He did not despise his Vinzi any more,
because he realized that he could be truly proud
of the boy and he showed it quite openly in the
way he looked at him.</p>

<p>Vinzi had been away a long while and had
lived in totally different surroundings. He had
learned a great deal, but had remained just as
affectionate and simple as when he had gone
away. This made his mother extremely happy,
and she sent a fervent prayer to God to keep
him pious and childlike upon all the paths of
his coming life.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
